For example, when the British left Iraq in the 1920's, there was chaos for a while, then stability, then they kicked out foreign interests.  Similar to when the British left India.  So why not get out very soon and let the violence happen - no question it will stop at some point and there will be (relative) stability.  An Iraqi intellectual recently confirmed as much:  leave, there will be violence for a while, then stability.  It's obvious there are some risks, like there always are.

The answer that were provided said that the \"\"beam\"\" is not solid and that in fact the photons in the beam are all travelling radially, with no tangential component. This I can accept. Now for my next installment:\\nImagine that there is a mirror in the shape of an anulus (ring) at a distance \"\"d\"\" from the lighthouse: \\n1) What is the value of \"\"d\"\" (let's call it D) such that the intersection of the beam of light and the anulus moves at the speed of light (c)?\\n2) If the anulus was at a distance of 2D from the lighthouse, what will the speed of the intersection of the beam and the anulus be?
