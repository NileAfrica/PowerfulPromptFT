I also wish that the artwork will be hung anywhere on the second or third floor\u2019s wall.

Here is what I got from wiki:\\n\\nThe extinction coefficient for a particular substance is a measure of how well it absorbs electromagnetic radiation (EM waves). If the EM wave can pass through very easily, the material has a low extinction coefficient. Conversely, if the radiation hardly penetrates the material, but rather quickly becomes \"\"extinct\"\" within it, the extinction coefficient is high.\\n\\nSo I guess that would mean that the higher the extiction coeffcient the better the ability to absorb light?\\n\\nIt also asks to provide a scenario where the above order might change.) the substance with the highest extinction coefficient above may no longer be the highest)\\n\\nI guess this would be under light with a differerent wavelength",
