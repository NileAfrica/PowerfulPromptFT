A real miracle in my opinion! I don't know what kind of headaches I get (sinus? maybe) but whenever they're bad, I use this little guy, and I would say 95% of the time, within 20 minutes of inhaling the steam, the headache is GONE. I can't say this will work for your headaches, but it has for me and it lets me start functioning again. Just be careful when you first use it - you need to adjust the opening for the right amount of steam and gauge how close you get to the facepiece so you don't burn yourself, because the water is literally boiling.

But with so many talented Latino actors available to do the part of the Mexican bandit, one can only imagine how much better the film might have been. The story is engaging, and James Coburn's performance is memorable. The music by Enno Morricone adds to the film's appeal. SergioLeone's directing is clumsy in places, and juvenile in others. However, the film is a wonderful story about the bonding of two men from very different backgrounds,and they way one of them grows to a new potential and level of actualization.

It's my go-to lunch when I need something quick at work or I'm not feeling well.The bowls are also reusable--I've noticed my coworkers using them for other things--so that reduces landfill waste.My only gripe is that while it's 110 calories per serving, a serving is half a bowl.

        "ori": "Once in the LifeDuring a brief jail stay, two half-brothers, who have rarely seen each other while growing up, connect. One of them, called 20/20 Mike because he can sense people nearby, concocts a scheme in which the two of them will steal some dope from young couriers. The heist goes awry when Billy, the junkie brother, shoots the victims of the theft. The brothers hole up in an abandoned building, and 20/20 Mike seeks help from an old cell mate, Tony, whom he thinks is out of the life. It turns out that they have stolen Tony's dope, and Tony's boss wants the two thieves dead. Perfect dialogue without the typical clich\u00e9s. This movie relied on the actor's talent and it was pulled off. Laurence Fishburne was superb at playing a career petty criminal. Titus Welliver is fabulous as Fishburne's junky half-brother. I think the best acting in this movie came from Gregory Hines and Michael Paul Chan, they paired perfectly as two of Calderon's henchmen. Great crime drama with very good acting.",

However, I have deep reservations about just how crazy Fish was. Essentially everything about Fish's psychological quirks comes from one source, the notorious Dr. Frederick Wertham. Wertham was a gullible, naive pseudoscientist whose absurd antics in the early 50s are well-known. Since Fish rarely told the truth about anything, and virtually nothing can be reliably documented about him beyond a few anecdotes from family members, and since his only chance of saving his life was an insanity plea, I am extremely unconvinced that Fish was quite as incomparably weird as he made out. Apart from that this is one of Schechter's usual good jobs of research. His real \"\"find\"\" was the lawyer who defended Fish, who provided a large amount of detailed, \"\"inside\"\" info about Fish's trial.",

You become invested in the characters. At heart, it's a story about a little girl trying to get to know who her parents were. Kostova manages to incorporate the history of the Cold War and the myths of Dracula without becoming overbearing about either. I'm a complete book snob, and I loved this novel. Of course, by way of disclosure, I am a historian and thus have a little bias when all these heroes happen to be historians, too.

I too am concerned about the holes though. The best way to fix those kind of holes is to make a slurry of dish washing liquid and paint it on, you can use some red food coloring in it to help you make sure you dont miss a spot. the airholes will make bubbles you can see and patch. as for holes in the base there is some great underwater patch stuff you can get a a pool store, works for years! an added bonus of the dish soap is that if it gets into the pool it makes everything go to the sides and into the filter, it's the neatest trick. been doing that for regular maintanance for years, plus mosquitos can't lay eggs on water that has a soap film.",

This game is great for short, quick plays, and it's also great for long play-sessions that last into hours of the morning that you didn't even think were real. (Like 4 A.M., since when is that an actual time??) There are a few shortcomings, such as the little amount of customization and crafting. However, the fact that this is a one-time buy, that's right, there are no monthly fees, evens this out. All in all, this is a game for mmorpg lovers and single-player-rpg lovers to spend time on. Also, as stated by another, DO NOT buy this game used, because the game is fully installed, and you can play without the disk. So, somebody could sell you their used copy, and then keep playing, while at the same time, you would be at a $40 loss. Buy it new, and have fun!",

Lots of strong diva vocals take away the ridiculousness of the lyrics, and bring you into a frenzy of body movements. The sample of Raze's \"\"Break For Love\"\" is wonderful. It's too bad that the other mixes are not as powerful. The Jonathan Peters remixes are ok, but nothing stupendous. The Wyclef mix is good if you are a fan of R&B/Pop and the Salaam remix is an interesting mix which deserves some listening. The new remix of \"\"It's Not Right But It's Okay\"\" is alright as well, a little bit slow, but not bad. The Thunderpuss remixes are what make this disc worthwhile.

The hardest part was digging out the collection of Torx bits from the barn. Not sure of the size, but it used the largest bit in my collection.A little dab of penetrating oil on the screw seemed to make life much easier. The replacement strut had a clip assembly on the top mount, which made installation even easier. No need to disassemble the clip, it just snaps right on.

And capable of broader appeal. It, alone, is worth buying this CD.Bartlett's mallets and the sonorous tones he gets from his marimba bring new insights and, for me, a deeper interest in the piece. His dynamic range and subtle approach to tempo variations make repeated listenings possible, and in the end it's a dynamic performance.Although the mood of \"\"Opening\"\" may seem melancholic or wistful to some (tho to me it's a feeling of \"\"openings, the pulsing forward of events when you have excitement tempered by past loss or nostalgia\"\"), take it as a meditation and master-class example of Glass' modern masterpiece.

The music is equally impressive as the band fool around with odd time signatures and make full use of their musical skills, creating moody, atmospheric landscapes. Jonny Greenwood's guitar work is absolutely stunning. Radiohead are now a group that generate a lot of hype and are generally considered the best British group in recent times with many copy cat follower bands.

What I find most annoying about this novel is that, having been the same age as the protagonist in 1983 when the book was written, I can safely say that no teenagers spoke in the language that her protogonist and his friends speak in. It's as though they were transported from a 1941 and are forced to use words like \"\"mightn't,\"\" \"\"stocking feet,\"\" \"\"Why are you so down-in-the-dumps\"\" that only a woman of Highsmith's age would use. This is especially troubling because I love the plot and the religious conflict she creates (so far), but the teenagers' personalities seem false and contrived for 1983. Even the party scenes seem less MTV/Friday Night Videos and more like leftovers from the 40s MGM musical \"\"Good News.\"\" The teens even hang out in what seems to be the equivalent of a malt shoppe.

The best part is the new addition of the attached remote control so you can change the tracks while it's in your pocket.This new design is great and I have not had any problems with it at all. This year I think Sony made the \"\"Psyc\"\" cd player pocket friendly so that you wouldn't have to hold it in your hand because the cd does not skip while it's playing in your pocket. One more thing to mention, it's a very good price for an excellent cd player!",

So without telling anyone she goes down to the bus station and plunks what little money she has (is allowed to have) down on a ticket and is off on her little odyssey. Much of her life and heartbreak is told in flashbacks while she's on the bus, either in dream sequences or as she talks to passengers. It's very sentimental at heart, though it has something to say about dignity and age and, of course, about the value of one's roots. Very good in spots, though perhaps just a bit too leisurely.",

For instance on the prison planet, why not just shoot Spock and McCoy right away? Why set up this elaborate scheme with Iman's character and then surround them? I mean, what if they managed to escape? Which they did by the way.Also, why didn't the bioscanner on the transporter pick up the klingon blood that the two shooters had on their boots when they reenergized? How did they manage to beam out without the bridge knowing about it? These were some of the little things to be sure, but they really add up in this movie.A very disappointing movie.

The problem I have with this particular album is that there isn't another song that matches the colorful, catchiness AS \"\"Move Your Feet.\"\"Its trippy electro-funk beat and fun vocals are a dance floor necessity, but the rest of \"\"D-D-Don't Stop the Beat\"\" are relative filler. Campy 60's beach music revisited, ridiculously boring dance-pop and all-around less interesting tracks stand behind \"\"Move Your Feet's\"\" irresistible hook and memorable feel.Do not buy this album expecting retreads and/or similar songs to \"\"Move Your Feet.\"\" It's obvious Junior Senior have been riding the coattails of said hit and is no wonder that they've virtually slipped from popularity since its appeal has died down.What to expect next?

I don't expect the writer of a biography to be unduly deferential, or referential, towards the person they are writing about - I expect them to sound completely neutral - but the writer here often sounded as though he was looking at / describing Walt Disney from above. It's hard to put my finger on - it was just a little 'off'.There may be a better biography of Walt Disney out there - in any case, this one passed the time well and was entertaining.

Also, many other the references were either taken out of context or were very vague. In general, I had a hard time accepting most of the conclusions of the book, especially those about Walt Disney himself.",

One story in particular stands out as especially haunting- the opening story, Beauty and the Opera or the Phantom Beast; as you might guess, it deals with the Phantom of the Opera- leaning more towards what the internet would term Christine - Erik shippers- but be warned- it's not all roses.

They are flat and inconsistant in their behavior. Even the Ayn Rand-esque main protagonist seems poorly thought out and tiresome.The story has many interesting points, and some of the future society ideas are very well done. But the plot that they backdrop is far less interesting. I often wondered where events were coming from. And the ending seemed self-indulgent and disappointing.I love a great deal of RAH's work, but this isn't one of them.",

You wouldn't know by listening to songs like \"\"Tight A$\"\", \"\"Aisumasen (I'm Sorry)\"\", \"\"Intuition\"\", or \"\"Meat City\"\", though. Musically, there are also a couple bad ideas (an enormous choir on \"\"One Day (At a Time)\"\", pedal steel on \"\"You Are Here\"\"). So the best songs are the good ol' fashioned revolutionary ones: \"\"Bring on the Lucie (Freeda People)\"\", the wonderful title song; \"\"Only People\"\". And a couple of the above poorly-written songs have some merit: \"\"Intuition\"\" has a bouncy melody and interesting keyboards; \"\"Tight A$\"\", a slide guitar. And I do like the gentle, sensitive \"\"Out of the Blue\"\" and the almost Macca-like \"\"I Know (I Know)\"\".

The best part of the book was when the authors took to describing all the financial players involved, their egos, and ways of life and doing business. The excesses of some of the companies detailed are really something. If you are interested in this topic then I would suggest you also read \"\"Den of Thieves\"\" and \"\"Predator's Ball\"\", both of which cover the 80's M&A and Junk Bond world.

For example, never once are we, as readers, privy to the financial situations of the main characters? What reference was there to the various market forces acting as the invisible hand, stabilizing the intersection of supply and demand? Is Steel simply living in a world without economics?

Even if I give it lots of space in terms that everyone copes the way they best can, still none of them sounds human faced with such a tragedy. As if this is not enough- the end just totally enraged me. Oh, faith! How thee trickest us all!

As a \"\"new age deadhead\"\" I was sympathetic with the book at first, but her self-seriousness, the kitschy drawings and prose, and the deification of Garcia just about did me in. My guess is Jerry would have hated it. I wonder what Bob really thinks... At the end of the book, she solicits readers' spiritual experiences, dreams, etc. with Jerry and other band members. It sounds like she is planning a sequel and is heading for a career as the spiritual teacher for Jerry-worshipping deadheads. This is the kind of stuff her brother sang about in \"\"Estimated Prophet.\"\"",

If one needs an example of Deep Purple, nearly any other album will do a much more accurate representation. Not that this is not the original band in \"\"Coverdale\"\" form, they just seem to have gotten full of themselves and dropped this goose egg into the listener's birthday cake. This sounds like an overly-orchestrated attempt to sell out, put out the 'pop'. Coverdale is not to blame as is easily heard on the \"\"Burn\"\" disc, \"\"Stormbringer\"\" has no direction and is executed without conviction. The production quality is just as uneven. A track-by-track analysis is not possible as one track will poison an attitude for any other track. Just don't.",

This CD captures a particulary good performance and is worth buying both for the price and the quality of the singers. I don't agree with other reviewers about the quality of the sound. The voices are not well balanced against the orchestra. It almost sounds like the singers were too close to the microphone. I found it hard to find a comfortable volume for listening. Maybe the fault lies in the digital remastering, or maybe I just got a bad CD. Addendum: I have had a chance to listen to this recording several times since I wrote the above review. It really is an excellent performance, and I got used to the sound quality. It is definitely worth buying and it gets better each time I listen to it.",

The resolution penned by Byrne involves a stupid decision by his foes, as well as a feat by Superman that even his powers should not be able to handle. Bad villain characterizations and improbable plotlines aside, Byrne seems unable to decide exactly how powerful Superman is in this post-\"\"Crisis\"\" universe.

Jet has been no help. Their service stations within 3 hours of here do not deal with lathes.The power switch on this lathe will go out on you too. Either have several switches on hand, or use an external in-line switch for it. This should be expected, as much as a person turns a lathe on and off.",

I was interested in the middle of the book in hearing the story of Thomas Effing, the man Fogg goes to work for, and how Fogg is affected by this old man. However, the last third just lost it. I was reading along, and when I saw where it was heading I kept thinking: don't do it, don't do it--oh no! Auster did it. Then the whole story seemed contrived and obvious for me. It's too bad because it started with such potential.I'm not giving any plot points away because others seem to really love this book, so I won't give the spoilers that killed the book for me.",

But I didn't really like Thorn- for one thing, most human heroes would have done what he did-and the Chinese lore had some mistakes-for one thing, Chinese dragons use magic to fly, not wings!(They don't have wings, either.) And their pearls are in their mouths...and they can turn into clouds to rain water...and Shimmer doesn't sound like a Chinese name. And Monkey King's master was not born old! Nor was he called the Old Boy. IF you are looking for a book that's just a little above average,that's slightly bland, with average characters, average boring writing style and great plot ruined by not enough hmmmmm, work, care, then this is it. If you are looking for a book that is deep, thoughtful, and relates to you and manages to be an engrossing story,too, then check out Dragonwings, Child of the Owl, and Thief of Hearts. Not this.",

He bites a German farmer who then turns into a vicious mutant rabbit/human! All the men appear as dorks in this film so it left to the five girls to dress in bunny outfits to try and trap him/it.

It was pretty interesting and reluctant-reader friendly: fascinating setting, sympathetic characters, and the plot was definitely nail-bitingly tense towards the end. There were a few things that seemed really contrived (really, the box containing the key to the city's survival sat, forgotten, in a closet for a few hundred years? And is discovered Just in the Nick of Time?), but it's still a solid starter-dystopia. I'd suggest this to kids who are still reading the early Harry Potter books and other fairly easy chapter books with a (very) slight edge to them.[...]",
