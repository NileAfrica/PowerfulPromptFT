First I gave it the scratch test and found that it had rough edges that would hurt the dog's skin and tear its coat, so I used a piece of steel wool on the tips so that they would be smoooth and safe to use. The rotating pins make a rattling noise as they rotate, so it isn't too quiet to use, but I think it's a lot less stressful on the dog than the bladed matt cutters because this rake doesn't pull the skin nearly so much. Overall this rake was easier on the dog and me because it gets much more hair for much less effort than a regular rake or coarse comb. I'm glad I got it.",

The now infamous 1988 Carbon-14 dating is laid bare for what it was: a poorly orchestrated effort on potentially contaminated samples of the Shroud which were snipped from an ill-conceived location.

In an earlier chapter, Sharon mentions seeing a lamp shade out of place in Laci's house during the police walk-through, yet she never draws a parallel, wondering if the lamp broke in the struggle, and Scott never disposed of the shade? Did any one else pick up on this?",

Some of the photos are quite stunning, but the majority of them are not. The lengthy captions only add to this impression. They often try to excuse lackluster images by lamenting the difficulty of the hike, the fact that his equipment malfunctioned, and how the weather didn't cooperate. Those are things anybody who's taken a hike with a camera has experienced. As a professional, his job is to spend the long hours to get perfect shots, discard the imperfect ones, and then not moan about how difficult the whole process was. It is also disappointing, to someone who knows the Adirondacks well, that the photographer limited his outings to the most accessible and popular summits. The views from these summits are wonderful to experience first hand, but as published photographs they border on clich\u00e9.",

I can't speak to the taste, but the recipes sounded good even to a non-sushi lover like me, and they didn't sound too complicated.

Never thought I'd see great actors say lines so stupid -\"\"How'd you do that? How'd you do that? How'd you do that?\"\". 2. Bad editing/continuity. Cillian gets his face graphically beat and bloodied in a restroom, and the next SECOND there is very little blood on his face? 3. Bad storytelling. Scenes go on pointlessly, nothing to do with the movie (a line of salt in Deniro's room?), and worse - using fakey newscasters and news broadcasts to tell key (yet redundant) points of the story.

Then, big city boy Klein comes into town and steals Sobieski's fancy. Harnett is getting jealous, but Klein says he doesn't have anything on him, but is soon falling in love, too. Sooner or later, love unwinds and Harnett confesses. But you would think that Sobieski would go for the old, well-known Harnett, but she chooses the new, Klein, and goes to Boston, bringing Sobieski and Harnett friends again. Then they have to make the ending disappointing. Sobieski dies of an infected cut on her knee, which leads tragedy to the rolling credits. But the movie wasn't as bad as many thought.

The image suffers from waxy skin tones, excessive DNR noise reduction, excessive sharpening, black crush in near black ranges of the image and generally mediocre tone and detail. Of course it's \"\"better\"\" than a DVD, if only because what appears to be the same transfer used for the DVD benefits from the added bandwidth and resolution of Blu-Ray.

It comes with a felt top and an additional cotton cover and overall is quick and comfortable.The only thing we don't like is that you need to keep it plugged in to deflate it and when you roll it up, some air is still stuck in the nooks so you need to push the deflate button a few times while you roll it up.

Nevertheless, I woud say it has a somewhat interesting plot. This film was the one that Heston had made immediately shooting \"\"The Ten Commandments\"\" (1956). I guess he had been quite exhausted after such an arduous shoot when making \"\"Three Violent People\"\". Yet the film is not very historically accurate and the supporting actresses are played by Hollywood glamour girls such as Anne Baxter. I'm a man quite older than Mr. Heston, being eighty-seven, and I remember seeing this film in my theatre for the first time in 1957 at about age 45. I had taught history prior to this for 22 years and thought that this film only wanted to gross in money instead of following the books. Yet the effort Heston puts into this film is fine. I'm sure this picture would've been more of a success if C.H. was allowed to choose his own actors to play these parts.",

Moreover, I doubt the name Jesus was ever used as a title, as Unterbrink claims. Why discounting the Jesus of the Gospels as an individual in His own right just because legends were told about Him...as were told about Alexander, Caesar, Charlemagne? Geza Vermss and J.

The team of soldiers sent to the desert are there to figure that out, too. As I watched, I expected that there would be some kind of answer to those questions, but the movie provides very little answers and the ending is pointless.The special effects were pretty good for an indy film, and the acting was also good.

The film gets an extra star simply for the gorgeous photography and excellent farm house sequence, other than that there is very little to offer with this snooze fest. Newman and Andrews are pretty much wasted as a couple in Berlin posing as spies. They do the best they can with a suspenseless (a word I thought I would never use when reviewing a Hitchcock film) story. The whole movie was just so damn lethargic. You do not really care about any of the characters in this movie or what happens to them. Hitchcock would follow this with the far superior Topaz, however, even that film falls short in many areas. The late sixties found Hitch in a slump. He would be right back at his macabre mastery in '71 with the thriller Frenzy. This just happens to be one in the directors catalog that you can skip unless you are intent (like I was) on seeing everything Hitchcock has put out.",

It had nothing to do with her, and very little to do with anyone she was associated with -- certainly not enough to warrant the extent of her involvement. And even more difficult to comprehend was her annoyance with others, especially her boyfriend and best friend, when they tried to get her to back off something that had nothing to do with her and kept putting her in danger.I hope the next book in the series is better.",

AP3 is not a horrible movie by any means. I found myself laughing at times, but the true laughs are few and far between.I still need someone to tell me what is so funny about Mini-Me.

However, since those of us in this category may only spend 1-5 hours a week playing video games, that's enough to make the game worth our precious hours of game time. The game is simple to learn. No complicated fight combos and fighting is only occasionally warding off ghost. No graphic gore or bouncing breast, making this a good choice for kids and women.

Scott Bakula has a great performance as Alex Michaels, Kris Kristofferson delivers once again, and Brian Dennehy makes a good effort.

Arendt should have ditched this hyper-masculinist, romantic Grecophilia after it got us to Auschwitz. Go read Hobbes or Montaigne if you seek a far more humane perspective on life after human carnage (in their 'bourgeois' determination to keep romantic-mystical yearnings out of the public sphere).

She plays a very one dimensional drug rep who coaxes Ben Stiller's character into promoting a new ED drug.

I'll agree with another reviewer that the ensemble playing is not the best, and sounds unpolished in several songs. The soprano is quite good, though. And there are a number of good little dances. Ballads like Robin Hood & the Curtall Fryer, Robin Hood & Maid Marian, and The Wedding of Robin Hood are all classic humorous Robin tales. Unfortunately, enjoyment of them may suffer from the lack of a lyrics sheet.

But this volume stretches the Paarfi-device too thin, because so *little* actually happens in the plot. As another reviewer pointed out, this story could have been charmingly told by Brust in 50 pages. Even Brust-as-Paarfi could have told it in 200 pages! But in fact, Paarfi tells this story in about 400 pages. The diversions and circumlocutions that were so enjoyable in previous volumes have overwhelmed the story. There's too much filler, too much padding.A cooking metaphor might resonate with Brust and his readers. Suppose a novel were a bowl of Hungarian goulash. In previous volumes, Paarfi's style was like a generous measure of paprika; it colored the whole dish, and added a layer of depth and flavor. But in *this* volume, the chef seems to have dumped a pound of paprika into a single bowl of goulash. What would Mr. Valabar say?",

The orchestra was noted for the quality of its playing but also for the concertos and symphonies composed by the Stamitz family. These were vibrantly exciting works for their day and still stand comparison as concert pieces with those composed by their contemporaries, Mozart and Joseph Haydn especially, but also lesser known figures such as Christian Cannabich, Johann Baptist Vanhal or Michael Haydn, brother of Joseph. It was the range of dynamics in the works played by the orchestra with such talented players that particularly earned them their reputation of being the best Court orchestra in Europe. If you enjoy listening to the music of this period, this CD of four symphonies by Carl Stamitz played by the London Mozart Players directed by Matthias Bamert for Chandos will delight.",

He wrote this book during the late Cold War, which makes its general fairness all the more impressive. Don't be fooled by the title, which sounds like some sort of role-playing game--this is a keeper.There are numerous funny stories in this book. Tolley, who spoke (perhaps present tense; word is he's still around) fluent Russian and adapted to Russian culture rather than attempting to bend it into something Americanesque, genuinely liked the people of Russia. He has done a fine job of separating this from his views on the Soviet political system, giving us a very fair portrayal of Russians (and to a lesser degree other USSR ethnic groups).This would be a fine read for anyone planning to visit Russia. While the politics have changed a lot, the culture has changed far less, and this book would help the visitor to appreciate it.",

The main female character, Mina Harker, is treated as an equal to the male characters (she was praised for her typing skills and her courage) and at the same time thought of as delicate and someone that needs protecting. It is a rather confused example for women's liberation to say the least. And my last comment deals with the fact that the ending falls horribly flat. All this suspense is built up, then in the final climatic scene (man vs monster) there's no struggle and it's all over very quickly without the extreme details given in the previous scenes.

Zero is an entertaining book, if a bit light. For quick popular science entertainment purposes it's a good choice. (Review based on the Finnish translation.)",

The one-dimensional quality of Rina (do we know much about her other than her hair is ebony and her eyes are blue?) in previous Decker novels should have warned me, but I laid out the bucks for \"\"Street Dreams\"\" anyway and had to force myself to finish it. Cindy's every action and scrap of dialogue is patently unbelieveable and forced--she's like Pete Decker in drag without the religious convictions that make him interesting. The boyfriend comes off as some kind of politically correct composite culled from a Frum Harlequin romance. The plot never comes together either, despite a nice twist toward the end. Do yourself a favor if you're in the mood for a mystery starring a woman, read Sara Paretsky or Sue Grafton instead.",

Janacek's music is there, but you can hardly hear it. Lenard doesn't pay that much attention to details, and tends to homogenize the spiky textures of Janacek's orchestration; he also phrases so that the motifs are choppy and not well-connected.

The painting is streaky, you have to carefully use roller on top of it to smooth the texture (while at the same time trying not to get too close to the ceiling). And it could get messy applying paint to this thing - you can easily get paint all over it.And it doesn't work on the baseboard lines since the wheels can't hold on to it.So bottom line, use it if you desperately want to avoid taping no matter what.

Called technical support and after 2 hours on the phone, found them to be completely useless. Took it to get repaired and was told by technician that the problem was MANY bad solder joints and that this was common with Sony. Brought tv home and it still won't receive NTSC. Now I have to lug this thing back to have it repaired again. I bought the Wega based on Consumer Reports ratings. Please, do yourselves a favor, DO NOT buy this tv, or any Sony for that matter.
