        "ori": "If you live in the city of Pittsburgh and don't want to drive to Wal-Mart, Giant Eagle - otherwise known as \\\"\"the Dirty Bird\\\"\" or \\\"\"Gian' Iggle\\\"\" if your accent's just right, is where you will shop. Period, end of discussion. Generally, I think monopolies are very bad, and this goes double for grocers because they know their customers are held hostage and can thus attempt whatever fuckery they'd like. Over the past decade, most other Giant Eagle locations in Pittsburgh's East End were shuttered, meaning that the Negley/Centre store serves everyone. \\n\\nPerhaps my biggest gripe with \\\"\"Market District\\\"\" is that our bills at this Giant Eagle were consistently 15-18% higher than our bills at any other grocery store, in any city I've shopped in - and that's WITH the coupons and Advantage Card \\\"\"discount\\\"\" added on. I guess in the end, calling something a Market District Giant Eagle is a clever way of telling customers \\\"\"We stock all the same crap you'd find at a regular store, but now we can charge you even MORE for pretending it's premium, organic, or has been blessed by Emeril Lagasse.\\\"\" You also need to know that over-crowding is unavoidable at this store, unless you like to start your errands around 10 PM, and even then, it's helpful to remember that customers exceed checkout lanes. Good thing we lived within walking distance of this location, because parking at this store is only marginally easier than driving a caravan of elephants through Manhattan at rush hour. \\n\\nThis store was never wanting for basic grocery staples when we shopped, but the \\\"\"Market District\\\"\" moniker somehow demanded that the aisles be set up to be as maximally non-sensical as possible. Do you want juice? Save your sanity, and don't expect it to be near the other juices...you'll want to look near the pasta, of course! To keep you on your toes, the store managers also randomly change the aisles at this Market District around a couple times a year. This is a common retail trick, intended to create \\\"\"excitement\\\"\" among customers, but really, all it does is make getting groceries as enticing as getting kicked in the balls. And who is stocking the produce at this place? Everything we bought would rot between 24-48 hours after we brought it home, and the peppers and tomatoes regularly looked like Mickey Rourke's face after his plastic surgery disasters.\\n\\nMy last visit to this Market District store left me with an exceedingly sour taste in my mouth, thanks to some shady hijinks at the pharmacy. We picked up my husband's script for a Schedule II medication, and soon after, discovered to our mutual horror that the pharmacy had shorted us 12 pills. 1 or 2, maybe 3 - that's an innocent mistake. A 12 pill shortage on a 30-pill prescription means someone chose a career in pharmacy to feed an addiction or run a little hustle on the side, and it means my husband will be going without. We asked the manager, \\\"\"Dude, what the fuck,\\\"\" and the response we got was, \\\"\"We didn't do nuthin'!\\\"\" Two weeks later, they had the nerve to Robo-Call my husband asking if he was interested in some \\\"\"valuable grocery coupons.\\\"\" Nice attempt at a save there Bub, but next time, don't snatch our money and we won't need those \\\"\"valuable\\\"\" coupons after all. (Isn't it also fascinating that we've been shorted on scheduled meds at other pharmacies before, but no one pockets our migraine meds, antibiotics, or other items you can't sell to teenagers in an alley?)\\n\\nTwo stars because the check-out staff is nice and the pasta/kosher deli selections rock. Otherwise, it's a grocery store, and a below-average one at that.",

The first floor: all the McGill paraphernalia and regalia you'd never need and didn't even imagine existed. Stupid over-priced t-shirts and other assorted crap that they try to get parents to buy for their kids.  All that's missing is McGill toilet paper (now THAT I'd actually buy). So no books on the first floor (although they used to have magazines there). The second floor has a computer store and a coffee shop with the remaining third of the floor devoted to real, actual books: fiction, philosophy, sociology, etc. But the funny thing is that several years ago they actually stopped stocking books so now they disguise the empty bookshelves by placing the books covers facing out on the shelves. If you actually place the books the way they're supposed to lie on a shelf, they'd have about a quarter left. Finally, the third floor has some books but mostly uesless text and reference books.  So there you go.  \\n\\nWord on the street is that the evil head librarian at McGill brought in her inexperience husband to run the show at the book store some years ago and he's been running it into the ground ever since. It's the same corporate bottom line mentality that's rife through all of McGill. Logic: You don't make money selling books. You make money selling souvenirs. So why bother with the books?  Um, I don't know because maybe you're a university that's supposed to be a center for learning? So less books, more McGill crap, and a coffee shop that isn't even open in the summer anymore although tons of students, faculty and researchers are still around. The only reason I go is the twice a year clearance of books in which they get rid of more and more of their dwindling stock at cut rate prices.  But I'm sure even that well will soon run dry as McGill University Bookstore eventually meets its aspirations of becoming the first bookless bookstore.",

The band was a GREAT country rock band.  \\n\\nUnfortunately the place is much much much too small for a band of that caliber and 2-step dancing.  This tiny little place had a tiny little dance floor where you were literally dancing right up into the singer's face.  3 couples at best could dance in there without running into each other.  The band is so close to the customers that you cannot hear a thing anybody says.  So you can rule out conversation. \\n\\nThere are very few tables and they were all completely full before we even arrived around 9pm.  No biggie, we can stand.  However...where do you put your drink when you want to dance?  We were standing right next to a table of people who were doing nothing but sitting. Not even a drink on the table.  So we would  occasionally set our drinks on the table.  The waitress proceeds to tell me that we are being rude by doing so.  Huh?  They had NOTHING on the table.  How am I being rude to set my drink down to go dancing?  If anything, those people were rude for taking a table and not ordering any drinks.  She should be telling them to move rather than telling off paying customers.  \\n\\nThe waitresses only serve tables. The bar is much too crowded to leave your space and try to make your way to the bar to get a drink.  \\n\\nCustomers are like sardines in a can. You can't help but feel up everyone around you because you are constantly being pushed, knocked and tousled into people.  If you meet some odd character that you want to get away from, good luck.  There is no way out and nowhere to go without being seen.\\n\\nBottom line, great idea but the space is much too small. They need to expand into adjacent areas or change the venue to something more like an acoustic guitar player, lounge type place rather than a multi piece band with dancing.   It just doesn't work in such a small space. \\n\\nI give it 3 stars for the great band and having a good idea. I hope you expand...oh and make table hoarders buy drinks or move on.",

I have had many cakes from lots of bakeries around town and I think the cakes at Albertson's are by far the yummiest! One of my favorites is the Victorian Lace cake with raspberry filling.  I have never seen it at any other bakery, which is a shame.  It is a beautiful cake and tastes even better! And yes, I have tried the big names like Freed's and I still think Albertson's has an edge on cakes.  What can I say, I LOVE cake!\\n\\nThis store also has a satellite USPS office inside.  This USPS location is rarely busy and you can get your stamps or mail packages quickly here.  It is a great option to have and is much faster than the main post office for the area on Tenaya.  \\n\\nThis location also has a Starbucks inside of it.  Yep, you can get your caffeine fix and then power grocery shop.  Talk about efficient shopping!",

Judge for yourself.\\n\\nNow, I am a die hard MJ fan through and through so I know my expectations. I was extremely excited to see this show up until it first began. Immediately, you can tell the production is completely low budget. If you are fine with that then you will love it. I, however; was distracted by some of the simple things like some of the cheap costumes. Also, a few of the background dancers were phenomenal, but others... how did they get the job? If you see the show there are two blond haired girls. One rocks and the other one falls completely flat. Then some were off beat and just not into it. Yet another distraction. \\n\\nI love cover bands so I can say the band did their job. They really played the music. I could have went just to hear them play. \\n\\nNow on to my main issue. The impersonator who played MJ made me uncomfortable. When I think of watching MJ himself, I think about standing on my feet the whole time feeling his energy. I felt this guy took his impersonation too far at times to a level of mockery. First of all, he looked like he belonged in The Mask with Jim Carey. People always say evil things about the real MJ's face, but this guy didn't even capture the MJ look. When I showed my daughter his picture, she immediately said he does not look like MJ. His face was clownish. Then his moves. While he is a great dancer, he is not the best MJ dancer I have ever saw. If you are impersonating him, do it all the way right. He made these nasty vomit faces and did some expressions MJ would never do. His pelvic thrust was all wrong LOL. He kept repeating a lot of the same dances like he didn't study Mike hard enough. He also mocked MJ by pretending to cry as MJ has in certain touching songs and then laughing about it. Like those moments were real from MJ so why start laughing? \\n\\nAnyway, to sum it up, if you are a real die hard MJ fan, certain things you may see will annoy you. If you just love the music, then this might be an awesome show to see. I would have preferred a show where normal people covered for him not this impersonator. Just dress like him, sing like him and dance his moves. All the extras were distractions.",

We talked for a bit, took x-rays, and then got right to work on treatment.\\nI received a follow up call the next day asking how I was feeling by Dr. Haggard himself and followed up today for my next treatment. We reviewed the final x-rays and then came up with a plan for correction. \\nAll in all I've been more than pleased with the treatment, follow through, and personalities at Haggard Chiropractic.

The food many on this site seem to like was overpriced and less than spectacular.  I have been there for dinner and brunch, and was disappointed by the fare and service both times. The turkey meatballs, which are touted as one of their specialties,  were tasteless and hard. The pizza dough was also hard and the toppings lacked any depth of flavor.  For brunch I ordered the  hash which was hands down the  absolute worst hash I ever had the misfortune to eat.  The cook must have known it was horrible as he tried to compensate by dousing  it with an enormous amount of salt.

Now, it saddens me that my first update of 2010 will be such a disappointing experience that was Girasole last night.  However, I feel the need to document the experience immediately.  If only some other yelper could have prepared us for such disrespect perhaps we wouldn't have been taken so off guard (hence my warning to you...).  The lady and I wanted to try somewhere newish and I hadn't been here in over a year when I was the second to review this joint on yelp in 5/08.  I'm sure much of what I said then applies today, very loud...decent service, a little above average food with a seasonal menu.  I call and make a reservation well in advance so as to try to mitigate what I seem to remember always being a wait...We arrived at 8PM sharp for our reservation and don't get anyones' attention for a little while, but eventually do see who I assume is the owner.   We mention our reservation, he says no problem 15 min...Great!  I understand you're busy and we'll just wait a while...15 min, 20 min, 25 min...Okay, I'll try to make this easy..\\\"\"Sir, may I please give you my cell so you can just call when the table for 2 opens?\\\"\"...\\\"\"Sure, what is it?\\\"\".  We go across the road to starbucks and wait for the phone to ring 30 min, 35 min, 40 min, 50 min...Now, keep in mind I booked a reservation well in advance.  We go back to the restaurant and wait again cramped like sardines cautious to make eye contact, which we do.  Okay, I know what you're thinking why not just leave?  I've already admitted it's nothing special.  I know you've been there...we kept thinking what if we leave now just when he's about to call.  So, we continue to wait and then someone walks in right behind us bumps Annie out of the way and just stands for maybe 30 seconds...the owner runs over bursts through Annie and I and just grabs the couple and seats them immediately.  I have never seen such blatent disregard for other customers'.  It was clear these folks were just regulars so he seated them ahead of everyone...what's so bad is it was right in front of us.  I can appreciate that we are not regulars' , but c'mon pops' have a little discretion.  Please take this as a cautionary tale, doesn't matter if you have a reservation, doesn't matter if you leave your cell (btw, still hasn't rang) and you pretty much don't matter if you're not a regular'.  There is a happy ending...We ended up at the bar at Eleven, I had a great tuna tartare and a piece of fish and Annie had a wonderful order of steak/frites.  We won't be back to Girasole.",

We would soon come to realize that this would be the highlight of the evening.\\n\\nFirst major problem: this club doesn't take credit cards! What kind of club doesn't take plastic? Maybe it was because we were American? Maybe the machines were down? (though I didn't notice any machine to begin with) In any event, when I attempted to hand my Mastercard over to the bartender, she waved her finger in my face (no!) and walked away.\\n\\nAfter settling the tab and taking a gander around the second floor, we knew right away this wasn't going to be the place for us. The club was kind of dingy, the crowd was less-than-appealing and the music was loud and terrible. Not ready to give up, we tried our luck on the first floor. As we walked out onto the dancefloor, the DJ starting spinning \\\"\"Whoomp There It Is' and the crowd went CRAZY like he just dropped that new Kayne track. Yep, it was time to go. On the way up to retrieve our coats, there was a wretched stench wafting out of the ladies room. I mean gut-churning, nose-pinching stink. Classy, Rouge, Classy.\\n\\nAfter doing a bit of research, I quickly learned that Rouge is a 25+ club geared towards the 'older' crowd who apparently used to frequent this other club Angel back in their more formidable years. Yikes. I'd like to chalk this one up to my big tourist mistake of the trip. Le sigh.",

It was a mixture of tomatoes, cucumbers, peppers and onions, that was accompanied by feta cheese and dressed with a vinaigrette. It was very delicious, if you like the tomatoes. If you don't, I would skip it. \\n\\nThe Milo Special:  At least this is what I think it is called. It was zucchini and eggplant that was lightly fried and had a yogurt dipping with it. That was the highlight of the night. \\n\\n(Meh: The Calamari and The Wine)\\n\\nThe Calamari: It was a little chewy. I didn't really care for it. \\n\\nThe Wine: It was sweet, but I could stomach it. \\n\\n(Cons: The Service/Staff and The Fish, The Atmosphere, and The Steak Fries)\\n\\nLet's Start with the food: The Fish was okay. It was basically red snapper with capers, lemon, and olive oil. It was okay, but I had better. It would be in the meh section, but it was 200 dollars. For 200 dollar fish, it better knock my socks off. Also,  it had bones in it. \\nThe steak fries were awful. There was no seasoning or anything there and they were soggy. \\n\\nThe atmosphere: It was was so loud in this place. I couldn't hear anything. We had a large party and couldn't hear half of the conversation. It was very loud. \\n\\nThe service and staff: They were slow. We arrived at 7:30 didn't leave until 11 or so. Plus, when I asked them to explain a few items on the menu they couldn't adequately explain things to me. (that is if you can hear anything in this place) They are also business people. They like to deceive you here.  \\nWe asked for water, they bring us bottled water that they charge 8 dollars a pop for. We asked for fish, they tell us that it can't feed a group of our size, and adds lamb, which is another 200 dollars. (I didn't eat the lamb that is why is it not on here). Its not the prices that were the problem, it was the fact that they deceived us and ranked up the bill. We had eight people and they added 18 percent gratitude on the bill which is probably why he was making a lot of the suggestions.  I rather you be upfront with me about the prices and let me make the choice if I wanted to eat there or not. This is the type of thing that is admired there, and it is a shame. I will not be dining there anymore. But needless to say, we were blindsided by the bill and took about 30 minutes to figure out, which they complained about. It was ridiculous. Never again will I eat there for some mediocre fish.  I had better fish for a 1/20 of that price. Real disappointment.",

The plan was to meet up for a nice dinner and then head to a show.  But being that I have to work late sometimes the plans ended up on getting something to eat quick in order to meet our showtime.  I arrived at MGM to pick them up and we immediately went to the food court, which was not my first choice being that I eat fast food every day and frankly the prices feel like I am at Wrigley Field. j/k however I noticed a place call \\\"\"Asian Fresh\\\"\" which I had never heard of which is rare being that Ive been in town for over 10 years.  The thing that attracted me to the place was the fresh food that was placed in the window right as you walk up.  I was amazed that a place in the food court would have such things as \\\"\"lobster, shrimp, fillet Mignon and most of all fresh vegetables\\\"\"  The prices on the other hand scared my out of towns friends half to death, but I told them based on the looks of the food it probably is worth it, and besides we would probably save money from where we were planning on going.  The service that was provided was the best I have ever had, the staff was not only friendly but assisted me with putting my order together based on what type of foods I liked.  I was amazed at how knowledgeable they were with the product.  I was more so impressed that I got to watch them make my food as I ordered it \\\"\"fresh\\\"\" which really put the word Fresh in \\n\\\"\"Asian Fresh\\\"\".  When I got my food I was taken back by the presentation that I almost forgot that I had spent of $40 for just my food, but then again it looked just like the famous strip restaurant \\\"\"Hammadas\\\"\" but way less and had more flavor. This is the best Asian infused meal I have ever eaten and recommend it to anyone visiting on the strip that want the best bang for your buck and especially if you are staying at the MGM Grand Hotel. You will not be disappointed, heck I think I try to eat there at least once a month.

What resulted was the age old rape the customer for every penny add as little value for as much money as possible snafu you'd expect from some mechanic stranded in the middle of the desert a la  Billy Bob Thornton's character in the movie U Turn.  \\n\\nThe tire ended up being the tube only, $150, okay I can live with that at the Harley shop.  The synthetic oil change $130, same deal.  I decided to go ahead with the 20K service as well, which was $385 and negated the oil change cost, so I was around $560 after tax with those services.  Painful yes, but again, expected due to the market cornering logo Harley Davidson being attached.\\n\\nBut here's where things went awry.  I received a voicemail from Ari in the service department the next day, as I avoided the call hoping to check my messages and simply be told the bike was done and ready for pickup, but something made leary of answering.  I checked my voicemail to find Ari had left a message detailing all the great things they had done to my bike which we had never discussed and they made the executive decision to \\\"\"fix\\\"\" like changing my amber colored light bulbs to red and removing he smoked out lens covers, so as to allegedly keep me  with the law.  They also changed the bolt which fastened down the leather strip accessory on my back fender, as they claimed it had been digging in to my back tire when I hit bumps.\\n\\nOk, great.  If the things you changed on my bike without consulting me helped me to stay compliant, and prolonged the life of my tire, great.   But then Ari, ever the salesman, err customer service rep, informed me my tail lights were no longer working and it would only be an additional $185 for parts and labor to get them fixed.  To wit, I responded, my taillights were working when I dropped the bike off yesterday, and they've quit working under your care, I'm not paying for you to correct the problem you created while making changes to my bike we never discussed.\\n\\nAri, oh Ari, said he would talk to his manger and came back with a response that he was given permission to waive the labor cost if I paid the $105 part cost to fix the taillights.  I reiterated my position about the lights working when I dropped it off, and somehow the price went from $560 to $585 and I agreed to do it versus leaving with nonworking taillights.\\n\\nDuring the conversation, Ari stated Harley Davidson gets enough jobs that they do not need to drum up extra business by creating new problems.  I told him I thought that was strange he felt to address or state that when I never accused them of doing such.  Basically if you have to create and state an alibi to something that hasn't been accused, it seems suspicious.\\n\\nBeyond the taillight debacle, Ari stated all bikes getting serviced in he HD service dept get a custom something or other power wash, so I expected to get my bike back gleaming at the very least.  After coming to an agreement about the taillights, Ari tells me \\\"\"I'd like to give it a bath if you have time.\\\"\"  I'm thinking, ya that's part of what I paid for.  So I waited another half hour for my bike, long enough to be approached by a sales lady who informed me they'd give me a whole $3K as trade in on my aped out, customized 2008 Nightster if I wanted to buy the $19K Fat Boy Lo I was admiring.  When Ari finally brings my bike around it looks like the time I washed it in the dark after a 12 pack, like Ray Charles washed it.  I told him it was a shitty wash job, and he responded we didn't do that, we could buff it out if you want.  Not even sure what he was talking about, but basically, ever the salesman, deny all plausability or accountability, like the taillights that quit working under their watch, and try to gloss over the subject.\\n\\nTotally disappointing experience.  They have a sign up on the lot next door about their upcoming new facility coming soon.

I am aware there are cheaper places to have my cars smog checked but I always go here because they are close to my house. They CHARGE more, so there is never any waiting. I have taken my cars there for over 10 years and feel that would make me a good and loyal customer. I went there yesterday and my car did not pass the test, the man working there asked me if I recently had my battery changed, I said yes. He said until I put 50 miles on my new battery my car will not pass. Fine, no problem except the test they did would be $13.99 and to get it retested it would ONLY be $10. So now instead of paying $5 more it's going to be $10 more than everyone else in town. I asked if the extra $5 fee could be waived since I am a loyal customer, he said no. I asked if there was someone over him I could talk to. He gave me the number for a Jim or Bill, I can't remember because I was very upset. This guy whom is supposed to be professional was so rude I felt like I was talking to a high school drop-out punk. I asked him if he was really willing to lose a loyal customer who has brought in 2 cars every year for over 10 years over a $5 fee and he said \\\"\"YUP\\\"\", not yes, just \\\"\"YUP\\\"\" like a no class uneducated idiot. Oh yes, I also said they should post a sign warning customers about if they had a new battery installed their car would not pass. The bully owner or manager replied \\\"\"We don't have to post any signs\\\"\". Really snotty. I know they don't have to post a sign, but it would be a nice courtesy for the customer, but wait , then they wouldn't be able to rip off the customer. Also if you use  a credit card or debit card there is a $1 SURCHARGE. This place cannot find enough ways to rip off the customers. I am disputing this charge with my credit card company, I so hope I win, not for the money, just the principle.

As a graduate student with little money, I appreciate the honest business and work that KC and his staff do at Valley Automotive.

We were ushered by a very nice man from NY past the grilling island were you could see them preparing your food and we were promptly seated. The atmosphere is pretty upper class with rich woods, a fireplace, darkened room and pretty quiet aside from the restraunt music and the chattering of other diners.

That is not a teddybear cut! Any groomer should know that a teddybear cut requires you leave the length of the muzzle around and round out the face around the jaw line. She then left all her hair around the body long and cut her legs very thin at the bottom. My poor puppy looked absolutely awful. The groomers reasoning was that my puppies hair needed to grow out evenly so  \\\"\"she\\\"\" decided to shave her muzzle down. Of course my puppy had plenty of hair around her face and muzzle to be able to wear a \\\"\"teddybear cut\\\"\" .. I was livid. I ended up buying my own pet clipper set and shaved her down more evenly, however her face now looks like a poodle, and now it will take months to grow back! She also had knicks from the clipper on her stomach, and long patches of hair randomly around her mouth. Absolutely ridiculous ! I will never have my dog groomed there again!!!",

Which is perfect because we really are bar people. \\n\\nNow the ONLY reason Im giving a 4 star review instead of a 5 Star is for the service. The bartenders couldnt have been bothered any less then to help us out. We sat at the bar for 10 minutes before we could even be greeted. When we finally were I ordered a Ciroc and Soda and the guy didnt even know what Ciroc was.. Now i would understand if I ordered something completely off the wall but I mean come on... thats pretty standard. Andy ordered a coffee and the bartender spatted off a list of different cappuccinos they had its like no dude, just a regular coffee lol The other bartender Nicole was also kind of a nightmare. She was giving away drinks left and right to the folks sitting next to us so maybe she knew them? \\n\\nBut when that was over we started ordering a few dishes.

This is probably one of the best food items Ive ever had in a restaurant. spicy dry sausage, san marzano tomato sauce, mozzarella, and oregano. But let me just talk about the crust for a second... That pizza dough could cure cancer. I mean seriously it was AMAZING. \\nFor dessert we had the zeppoli. Now im a huge fan of this dessert, its always been my go-to while at an Italian restaurant but this one was made like Ive never had before. It wasnt sweet, like Ive normally had. And it had lemon zest sprinkled all over.

I could watch t.v while putting on my make-up or doing my hair which was a nice perk. \\n\\nRestaurant food in the Resort was delicious!\\n\\nThe gym was fancy! Not your typical hotel gym with a few machines. Looks like they took the time to make it nice (you have to pay to use it but if you are needing a workout while on vacation it will be worth the money).\\n\\n\\nParking was free, albeit they didn't have a place for you to pull up to the front lobby and unload. That was reserved for Limos/Taxis and Valet only. So if you self park, you have to carry your luggage through the Casino to get to the guest room elevators. But hey, it was free so I'd take that over having to pay for resort parking at $10/day like other places I've been to. \\n\\nNow, the only reason I am giving this place a 4 instead of a 5 is because they have a ridiculous schedule for their pool. It is seasonal only--so forget about swimming or using the hot tub if you visit in the off season. It's Vegas---tourist town. People like to swim, sit in the hot tub on their vacation!! It is also only open from 10am-6pm during the open season!!! The pool itself is great. It has a perimeter of shallow calf-deep water where they have lounge chairs in the water. Then the rest of the pool is only 4-5 ft deep. Perfect for cooling off when the weather is hot. Plenty of lounge chairs outside the pool and they have cabanas to rent and awesome pool side food and beverage service. Free ice water if you don't want to drink alcohol but want to stay hydrated. So it sucks if you are in a business meeting all day and then want to relax in the pool in the evening, like my boyfriend. It is 90 degrees at 6pm and they close the pool.

Featuring no less than a dozen different varieties with three cronuts plus fritters, crullers, filled, raised, cake, and fancy on display it was with a bit of indecision that I pondered my options and eventually settling on a few personal favorites plus those most interesting a quintet was selected at a total of $12.50 and aside from the lackluster, artificial banana flavor of \\\"\"Monkey See, Monkey Do-nut\\\"\" the results were very impressive indeed; the 'cronut' as close to Dominique Ansel's original in texture as I've found (a plus for those seeking authenticity, though I still prefer Coco's rendition to both,) the Boston Cream featuring surprising subtle custard inside a delicate yeasty pocket, and the apple fritter rife with fresh fruit beneath a delicate sugar crunch plus plenty of cinnamon rivaling some of the finest I've ever sampled; the best in Las Vegas by far.",

I was disappointed to hear we were unable to meet your expectations with the room you received during your visit and apologize for any inconvenience. As a mature hotel, it is challenging to keep our product fresh and up to our brand standards, however, there is absolutely no excuse for you not to receive a room that affords you the comforts of home.

We are skeptical as to whether we found it at Red Rock. \\nThe pros are the staff. A lil' shout out to Ronnie who took care of us when no one else seemed able. Also, Britney at the pool really tried to get us our food, against all odds; we appreciated that. \\nFRIDAY, 8/29: So, let's start with check-in. When I got to our room the CD player was broken and there was an old, half used bottle of lotion left by the bed. Nasty. So, I called the front desk. I wish I remembered the name of the manager who \\\"\"helped\\\"\" me. I think her name began with an \\\"\"s\\\"\", she was around 5'2\\\"\" with long dark brown hair. She sucked. \\nHer first question was short, \\\"\"Well, what do you want us to do?\\\"\" First, I'd like you to stop being a bitch. Barring that, could I please have a new room? She offered to send someone up to clean the room again and to look at our CD player. If I wanted to wait around for housekeeping and a maintenance man, I would have hung out with my landlord for the weekend. It was 8:30, I just wanted to settle in for a few minutes, shower, and pick up my husband at the airport. \\nI asked for a room change, which really seemed to put her out. And when I added that our room was overlooking a parking garage and was there any way we could have a better view. she cut me off numerous times, assuming she had some idea of what I was going to say. We didn't care if we were looking at the pool or Red Rock--I was perfectly happy to look at the strip, I just preferred not to look at Level 4 of the East Garage. \\nLong story short: We were eventually moved and got a better room, but not before the the manager unloaded her obvious stress on me at the start of my \\\"\"relaxing\\\"\" weekend. I really wish I remembered her name. She was working Friday, August 29 at 8:30 pm. That's all I've got. \\nSATURDAY, 8/30: On to Saturday. We get a couple's spa massage package. When my massage therapist calls my name, she followed through by snapping her fingers, saying in a chirpy voice, \\\"\"We are just trucking through these!\\\"\" That is NOT the first thing I want to hear before a massage. You're going to TRUCK through my hour of relaxation??? And truck she did. She was *fine*, (good pressure, adequate technique. Didn't really listen to my specific requests though)   but about 10 minutes before the end of my massage she says, \\\"\"I'll be right back!\\\"\" Is gone for two literal minutes (a long time in paid massage time), comes back and gives me the roughest head massage to finish. Seriously, I've had noogies from my brother that were more relaxing. The kicker is that she took two minutes out of my massage to deal with \\\"\"maintenance issues\\\"\", but didn't give me two more minutes at the end. \\nWhatever. I headed back to the spa, with a plan to relax in the jacuzzi only to find a layer of blackened scum floating on the top. Gross. \\nWe head back up to our hotel room with a plan to hang out in our room tub and drink some bourbon. \\nWhen we get back, we realize housekeeping hadn't refreshed our glasses, so we call down for clean glasses and an extra robe. An hour passes... we call down again. 30 minutes pass... we call again. 20 minutes pass and we get our requests--finally learning that they had asked housekeeping to bring us our stuff. She had been cleaning other rooms. \\nSUNDAY, 8/31. We go out for breakfast. Come back. Our room is cleaned... and our housekeeper had respectfully chosen to leave our dirty bourbon glasses from Friday and Saturday there for us. Apparently she thought we were taking up a collection. \\nMONDAY, 9/1: Our last day. Housekeeping comes knocking at 8 am. We hear the room key and have to wake up after a VERY LATE night, to turn the paddle lock. Pass out. 8:45, housekeeping is back. Granted, there is a DND button by the door, so it was partially our fault. But... 8 am? We're checking out in three hours.\\nWe decide to spend our last few hours hanging out by the pool. When we get there we want to order breakfast by the pool. Only \\\"\"today only\\\"\" they don't start serving until 10. Totally fine, but it seems like a bad call on management's part. It's a long weekend. A very busy long weekend. This is generally the last day of people's stay. Why would you make brunch an hour later? \\nAnyway, not a bad weekend overall but, as you can see, there were quite a few glitches here and there. Also, the staff at the Red Rock were consistently helpful and pleasant (except for that stupid bitch manager... Friday, Aug. 29 @ 8:30 p.m. HATE HER)--so that's a plus. This place is fine, but it's not anything more than that. It's a shame because we live in LA and since my husband's family lives in Summerlin, we were looking for some place close to stay during our regular visits.

Today I was not having it, I was only paying for what the sign on the price advertised.  $4.49 for the Mango Magic smoothies and 99 cents for whey protein.  Somehow they calculate this to be $6.30!  THAT is the most I've ever been charged. The idiot guy at the window said well that is the price and I argued with him and said well the sign says something else and I'm only paying what the sign says!

Pro tip kids, ALWAYS bring a snack, I don't care if I sound 80 years old, when have you ever been disappointed when a snack appears?! \\n\\nAnyway, after we are seated, our host for the evening comes by, explains the menu and gives us some time to look it over. We're also introduced to the mixologist of the evening. Every drink sounds incredible, I want them all. Our waiter was also great at explaining each drink and making sure we knew what we were getting into. The G+T my GF ordered was infused at our table, explained in great detail, we even got to pass around the gin and smell it. It may have been $18, but it made her about 2 drinks. My drink (honey bee or something) came on fiiiire! Our last round of drinks also came on fire, which is just so much fun to watch. I wish I could remember what it was called, but I'll just have to go back. Who knows, it might actually be against the rules to tell you anyway. \\n\\nThe rules, yes there are some rules. Guys, you don't get to be sleazy and walk up to girls and hit on them. Also, no swearing. I broke this a few times, luckily it wasn't too loud and our waiter was no where in site. Flash photography, NOPE. The group next to us did get a slap on the wrist for this and my friend did mention she saw people get kicked out once for that. There were a few others, mostly, just don't be an ass and keep the place classy. \\n\\nOh, we also ordered food (try the grilled cheese and the scallops, soo freakin good). The 5 of us had 5 dishes and 7 drinks + tax + tip = $50ish a person, not bad at all in my book. Some of our drinks were more expensive, while others had more expensive entrees, plus the experience alone made me not care about dropping dough. Would I go every weekend? No. Would I want to go every once in a while, especially on a girls night? Heck yes! \\n\\nMy advice, get there early! The place only has space for less than 50 people. If you show up at 9PM on a Friday or Saturday, of course you are going to wait. What do you expect? Also, it's not some shit bar on Mill. You aren't going to get away without dropping at least $20-$30 on a few drinks, but they are worth it. The 2 drinks I had were perfectly made, got me buzzed, and came on fire.

A fresh tortilla makes a world of difference to the enjoyment of the taco. Some of my favourite tacos in the world are just plain, $1.50 tacos that are with some plain 'toppings' a good verde salsa, in a warm, fresh tortilla. I say all this because I think that Verde puts too much emphasis on the ingredients (Which are still under-spiced and boring with some store bought hot sauces on the table giving all the flavor) and then put those toppings into a boring, store bought tasting tortilla.

The bear looked as if it was picked up at the dollar store with the eyes glued to the top of the head - threads hanging off every seam - and strands of dried glue strung across the surface near the hands, feet, and nose where there was a piece of cheap felt glued on. The chocolates came in a flimsy plastic heart-shaped container (that was broken) that, again, looked as if it had come from the dollar store.

        "ori": "I love design so I used to check out Barami for high-end furniture somewhat regularly. It's a massive store with enticing eye candy. They're known for doing Made in China knockoffs of high-end furniture, i.e.) a replica of 'design' couch that is normally $10,000 may be $5,000. Unfortunately however, the staff doesn't have much knowledge of design so they can't tell you what the pieces are replicating. But if you have any knowledge of design yourself, you'll quickly recognize the pieces that are knock-offs.\\n\\nIt took me too long to realize that there is little to no workmanship in Barami's products. First, we bought a couch that looked amazing but came apart in less than two years. Same thing with a chaise lounge. The fabric's staples popped off the couch on their own. I bought a desk that wobbled because the legs were uneven. We bought stools that once we brought them home, noticed they were made unevenly. I bought a decorative (and expensive) light fixture for the kitchen but several of the pieces fell off on their own. Such poor quality. We kept everything we bought at Barami and tried to 'fix' them ourselves because we'd already paid so much for them. But the kicker was a plexiglass folding chair that I bought and which looked fantastic just sitting in my office, so I seldom used it. One day though, while I did happen to be sitting on it at my computer, doing nothing out of the ordinary, the seat of the chair completely snapped in two! It's not like I'm a heavy person so it must have been a manufacturer's defect - but a dangerous one, as I fell straight onto my tailbone (ouch!). I informed the staff so that they would be aware of the defect for future buying and I asked the staff if there was anything they could do about it i.e.) a repair, an exchange, a refund etc. and they nonchalantly said, 'no'. As one salespoerson told me, 'it's not like a massive factory like Barami needs to worry about one person's little chair.' \\n\\nEverything looks great at Barami but it's more for people who don't want to actually use their furniture - but just keep up appearances. Maybe perfect for people who assemble 'showrooms' in condos?  I won't buy anything there again though, as I'd be better off getting something cheaper and more 'typical' looking - even from IKEA which believe it or not, is of better quality than Barami.",

        "ori": "So, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for AYCE sushi, I decided on Oyshi, solely because of the great reviews I saw here on Yelp. \\n\\nI looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and I decided to make the trip out. \\n\\nWe arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a Friday night, so I expected it to be bustling. During our wait to be seated,  I scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. Mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. Well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. It must be set on Pandora or something. Anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. \\n\\nSo, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. My boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the Oyshi scallops. As for the rolls, I decided on the Sibuya No Rice, Coco, and a Bonsai. I also decided to get the agedashi tofu, grilled beef asparagus, baked mussels and seaweed salad. This was only the first round after all.\\n\\nWe were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. First the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. \\n\\nVerdict, \\n\\nthe garlic tuna was DISGUSTING. It smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. I've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. It even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.\\n\\nthe albacore was seared, and also tasted old. It had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.\\n\\nthe Oyshi scallops I thought were going to be \\\"\"OISHI\\\"\" but, definitely not. They mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as I tried to pick it up. \\n\\nthe cajun albacore had TOO MUCH cajun seasoning! I usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was DRY.\\n\\nmy boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. \\n\\non to the rolls,\\n\\nthe Bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but I had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. The roll as a whole was not to my liking.\\n\\nthe Coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.\\n\\nthe Sibuya No Rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.\\n\\nthe appetizers,\\n\\nthe agedashi tofu is usually my favorite appetizer!!! It came out looking as if it were just fried up, and I commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and I hate that it is not \\\"\"bite-size\\\"\" as most Japanese cuisine is known to be. \\n\\nthe seaweed salad was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, I've had better, let's just leave it at that.\\n\\nthe grilled beef asparagus was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. The asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.\\n\\nthe baked mussels were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. \\n\\nI was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since I knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. I settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, asian style skirt steak, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.\\n\\nI knew it was bad when I was scarfing down edamame and tempura. The calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \\\"\"asian\\\"\" I guess? My boyfriend ate the skirt steak (aka Korean bulgogi, in my opinion). He even commented \\\"\"I'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing I would expect to eat at a Sushi restaurant.\\\"\"\\n\\nWith that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! \\n\\nHm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  We have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in Hawaii and San Francisco, California, and I wanted to seriously give this place a chance. Unfortunately, Oyshi just did not live up to the hype!\\n\\nOn a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it.",

        "ori": "Honest review of the food. BEWARE! \\nFellow yelpers you really let me down. I have to assume that the ratings for this place are based on the drinks or pure bribery. I was in AZ so I thought it fitting to have Mexican food. This place had some of the best reviews as far as Mexican places went on yelp and I decided to check it out.\\n\\nThe waitress was very pleasant. and the place was pretty much empty. I showed up around 8:30PM on a Sunday in November.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE\\nI give them kudos for the excellent music. A mix of current tunes and some 90s favorites. They also have some great TVs. Temperature wise, even with the door open, it was a tad chilly and I wore my coat. Be it known I mentioned to the hostess when I walked in it was chilly, and after no change, I let her know I was going to get my coat, which also led to no change in the temperature. Glad I had brought it. \\n\\nFOOD\\nIt started out well. I had the chips and salsa (you get green and red) I am a sucker for green salsa, and this did not disappoint. You do need to ask for the chips and salsa if you want them. I'm not the first yelper to mention this. Would be good it the management got the hint and reminded their servers to offer it. I put a little of the red salsa (which is Hot) in with the green to give it a little more zing. The chips were excellent.\\n\\nSince the Tacos seemed to be all the rave on yelp (maybe because they are $1 on Tuesdays) I got the platter of 2 which comes with rice and beans. Here is what I thought:\\n-Rice - bland, (ok, i know its rice, it wasn't bad rice, just not knocking my socks off. I liked that it was soft and not dry.)\\n-Refried beans- also pretty unexciting, but since they were the most edible thing on my plate much of it was eaten\\nTACOS Part One\\n-Grilled Ono Taco - this fish taco was very dry. even adding salsa/chalula couldn't save it.  I think this taco, with the fish cooked properly could be good.\\n-Carnitas  Taco - This shredded pork taco was insanely greasy and unexciting. One bite was all I could manage. The cilantro and onions were barely discernible accompaniments.\\n\\nSo the waitress comes over and asks how everything is. I take a deep breath and let her know about the tacos. She sweetly asks if she can get me anything else. Still feeling optimistic I go for 2 other tacos that she recommends which are popular ones during their happy hour. She walks away.\\n\\nA gentleman comes out and explains they are going to make me some replacement tacos and apologizes. I'm not sure who he actually was. No introduction was made. I told him I was optimistic and would definitely give it another shot. Just in the name of full disclosure, the waitress knew I was a yelper. I mentioned it a few times and I was taking photos of all the food she brought out.\\n\\nTACOS Part Deux\\nIn general, so many toppings were piled onto these two replacement tacos I think the chef was honestly trying to mask the mediocrity of the meat. (cheese, lettuce, tomato, sour cream - Taco Bell special)\\n-Shredded Beef Taco -  beef still a little dry, which can be expected. Didn't taste the green chiles it was allegedly marinated in. Unexciting\\n-Tinga taco - this shredded chicken taco was ok. It was marinated in chipotle sauce but was definitely still lacking something.\\n\\nI have to say there was not an onion in sight within this 2nd round of tacos. I wonder if that's what was missing from the flavor. Lack of seasoning. I can't imagine this is how Southwesterners like this food. \\n\\nAlso, these two replacement tacos (which didn't come out with rice and beans because I said I did not require another serving) came out on a tiny plate. I need to mention that another Yelper has also complained that squeezing two tacos on a small plate is extremely unwieldy. I looked like a little kid spilling tomato and cheese all over the table. Chef - Please just plate the two tacos on a large plate.\\n\\nI will probably go back one more time and try a few more just to make certain I didn't just have bad luck. It seems some of the other reviewers had tacos which I did not try. If my opinion does change I will make sure to update the review.\\n\\n$12 with tax/tip. I had a water.",

I reviewed the menu options online before our visit and had a couple Peruvian-influenced items in mind when we walked through the doors.  However, the restaurant now describes itself as a \\\"\"Mexican Grill\\\"\", so it was time for a quick change of plans (note to management - please update your online menu).\\n\\nAfter seating us, our server dropped off a basket of standard-grade corn chips and a bowl of pico de gallo.  The chips were heavily salted and were nothing to write home about.  The pico de gallo was excellent - it was loaded with fresh onions, cilantro and tomatoes along with a healthy dose of jalapenos.  My only problem with it was the bowl was too small and every time we tried to use a chip to scoop some out, most of the contents ended up on the table.  Because of this, we soon ran out of pico de gallo, but our server was too engrossed with a cell phone call to notice that we needed a refill.  \\n\\nAfter adjusting to the new menu, I decided about the beef version of the Cemita Poblana sandwich ($10).  The sesame-encrusted bun was a disappointment; it had the texture of a hamburger bun from the local Piggly Wiggly.  Also disappointing was the beef cutlet - too little beef and far too much of the greasy breading.   I did enjoy the rest of the sandwich, which included loads of buttery oaxaca cheese, slightly sweet caramelized onions, spicy chipotle peppers and perfectly ripe avocados.  \\n\\nThe $7 cheese quesadilla ordered by my daughter became a comedy of errors.  She is a vegetarian and the first version of her cheese quesadilla was peppered with small chunks of chicken.  We flagged down another server (our initial server was still busy on his cell phone) who apologized for the error and promised to make a cheese-only version.  It came ten minutes later, but this time, the thick corn tortilla was a soggy mess.  (I wonder if it sat on the counter too long, since the first quesadilla did not have this problem.)  The replacement quesadilla also lacked a serving of the salsa verde that added some much needed zip to this dish.  We again flagged down a server, and after another wait, we received the green salsa.  By then the whole thing was getting cold - ugh.  While my daughter did enjoy the melted oaxaca cheese, she stated she strongly preferred the $3 Los Gemelos version of this dish.  With no sides, this dish was a poor value.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant was extremely clean, flooded with natural light and nicely decorated.  \\n\\nOverall, the negatives of my visit (spotty service, lackluster food) outweighed the positive (superb pico de gallo).

Hostess #2 was initially hesitant but then said \\\"\"fine by me\\\"\". At first I thought perhaps, it would be a more quiet and romantic table. I was wrong, it was not just a small table, it was tiny. My husband's legs were crunched because we were sitting at right angles to each other instead of across from each other. Sitting across was not possible. The table location was facing the upstairs exit sign and right near the kitchen exit where all the servers come out with the food. We only stayed at the table because our server was so nice and we did not want her to miss out on a good tip. There was plenty of other seating available but the hostess seated us at the worst table in the restaurant. This definitely should not be given to people with a reservation or better yet, it should be removed. To give them some credit, the food was good and our server was top notch.  As we were leaving hostess #1 ducked her head and was laughing uncontrollably. Unbelievable!  Aria, you are only as good as your worst employee.

I remember driving by this restaurant on Las Vegas Blvd. and  wondered if it was any good.  I made a reservation through open table for 10:30am. and asked for a patio seating.  My mom decided that it would be too cold to sit outside in a 57 degree weather so we decided to sit indoors right next to their patio seating area.  Even at this time, the restaurant was pretty much filled up.\\n\\nIt's a pretty long walk from the self parking lot at the Paris hotel to this restaurant.  We were getting lost trying to figure out where it was.  You have to pass all the shops and the casino lobby area to the very front of the hotel.  Don't wear heels.  The food here is definitely worth trying out for brunch/breakfast.  \\n\\nStrawberry waffles---5 stars!  Very crunchy made with buttermilk batter and topped with fresh strawberries.  Goes well with their warm maple syrup.  Very light and not heavy.  \\n\\nHam and Cheese omelette with gruyere cheese--4 stars.  My mom ordered this and she seemed to be happy with her dish.  Came with bread (5 stars) I just can't seem to remember the type of bread but it was delish!  The hash browns were flaky and excellent.\\n\\nCrepes- BF ordered this dish but we were both not too pleased with the texture and overall taste.  I'd skip on their crepes.  2 stars.\\n\\nFrench onion soup-  Yeah, it's $9 for a big cup of soup.  BUT, it's worth every sip!  We ended up fighting for the cheeeeeeeese!  Not too salt unlike other soups I've tried.  This is one soup I'd come back and order again!  Must order as an appetizer. Big enough to share with two people.  5+stars!\\n\\n\\nCoffee--Very good coffee.   They are very good about offering refills whenever your cup is half way done.  5 stars\\n\\n\\nService--Top notch!  5 stars!

The service here, however, leaves something to be desired.\\n\\nOn previous visits to Penn Brewery we've enjoyed dining outside and have enjoyed the food. This week, we were excited there was a Craft Beer Week event here and the collaboration beers had the BF all in a tizzy. We made our way there (in rush hour and everything!), parked in the mini garage and made our way inside. Inside, it was a madhouse. The bar was jam packed. The tables were full. The hostess stand was abandoned. We awkwardly stood at the hostess stand since we were hoping to get some food while we were there. No one came, and no one came. When an employee finally came over, it was like he didn't know what a hostess stand was or how to operate said hostess stand. He was confused about what to do, handed us menus and told us we could sit anywhere. We snagged a table from two women who were about to leave and started to look over the menu. After a few minutes and no sign of a waiter, a waiter came over and asked us if we'd been seated here. Yes, we said, we were given menus and told we could sit here. 'Welllll (I'm channeling all three nasal-y Kardashians here), you can't sit here. There's a long wait.' But- b-b-b-b- the man said we could sit here :( 'Yeah, there's a really long wait.' This woman was SO rude. I was immediately peeved. We'd already been ignored, given false information and THEN rudely told to move like we were some sort of aliens trying to jump the 'wait' list. We were not offered to have our name put on the list while we waited at the bar, we were just told to MOVE IT. I looked at this rude waitress, looked at my accomplice, and said, \\\"\"CAN WE LEAVE?\\\"\" And we did. I tweeted them about it and they said 'We are very sorry about that! We'll let the staff know so we can prevent that in the future.' But what's done is done. And no free app or anything? Fuh-GET about this place and its shenans.

My night started with the checking of ID's and mockery of my age using huge, and seemingly permanent black  x's on my wrists. I'm used to having everything poked, prodded, and searched through but here as long as I paid, I was in. I could have taken a butcher knife inside of the venue and no one would have known. I'm not for invasion of privacy but I definitely want a little bit of security when surrounded by havock-causing stereotypes. The standing area was separated between 21+ and the less fortunate so I took my usual place next to the 16 year olds taking phone videos of the concert and texting their friends. \\nThe show was okay. I'm honestly don't know anything about sound systems and such being someone who has enjoyed the acoustics of a garage show before. So there wasn't anything noticeably bad...but I wasn't particularly impressed with much either. \\nAt the end of the show I started feeling really nauseated. It was super hot inside, the sweaty, shirtless were spinning and kicking in my direction, and my inability to LEAVE to get some air induced a feeling to throw up all over myself. Thankfully I didn't but I had to dive out at the last minute, not being able to bear the smell of greasy humans and what I deducted to be every one in the entire place to be taking a dump all at once. \\nFunny enough, I was told later by my boyfriend that there were two staff members desperately trying to push back an overflowing toilet in the bar section. Well...that explains that. \\nI DO like this place because it's dingy, small, and authentic. You feel like you're watching a show on a more personal level which makes a huge difference when watching a live performance. I also really appreciate the bands that they book.

She even offered a follow up visit for free after treating my over active dog for tearing his nail off. My only complaint is that the last time I was in I spent a ton of money on allergy medication and was told later by friends that other vets have suggested to use Benedryl instead of paying exponentially more for the prescription.

        "ori": "So normally I don't really review places other than eating establishments, but this review seemed necessary after the craziness that went down my first night in Rio.\\n\\nIt's 6am and I can't sleep. The time difference has not been my friend. I get up, and decide i'll waste some time at the gym. As I exit the elevator that connects the hotel rooms with the actual casino floor I am suddenly met by a big black sheet that spans the entire width of hall way. Along with the ominous sheet is: a handful of casino security, 3 or 4 metro police officers, and very tired looking casino managers. Everyone immediately points to an \\\"\"employee's only\\\"\" door to my left and directs me through. I walk down winding hallways, at each checkpoint another police officer pointing out the proper directions. Eventually I get out to the casino floor, and I notice another black sheet. Apparently I had just taken a detour via staff-only hallways in order to avoid a small portion of the main hallway that leads to the elevators.\\n\\nSo I decide that it is best to not hang around and I start to head to the gym, only to be met by police tape. Now I was a little more curious. I ask the guard what happened, and she immediately cut me off and insisted she \\\"\"could not talk about it at this time.\\\"\" So, me being the savvy millennial I am, I pull out my phone and google the Rio. Turns out undercover security shot an alleged \\\"\"repeat offender\\\"\" who was attempting to the rob the casino. A man was killed my first night in Vegas.... Definitely a story to tell.\\n\\nAt first Rio really did not handle this well. They didn't accommodate the people trapped out of their rooms (once you left your room and came downstairs, police wouldn't let you back up. \\\"\"Security measure\\\"\"....I was locked out for about 5 hours.)\\n\\nmy boyfriend and I weren't too angry about being locked out of our room because we were sure the hotel would be accommodating their customers and giving them things to do as they waited to back into their room. This just seemed like pretty basic crisis communications. When we went to talk to the manager though, this was not the case.\\n\\nThe hotel managers and staff wouldn't actually listen when we spoke to them. They just kept droning over and over, \\\"\"we cant let you up into your room, once metro is involved we have no control.\\\"\" This wasn't what we were asking though. We didn't NEED to get to our room, we just wanted something to do while we waited. We weren't the only ones either. People started getting really heated when they found out the hotel wasn't offering any kind of distraction. Eventually though, with quite a bit of complaining the hotel finally started giving people champagne brunch vouchers and waiving hotel fees.\\n\\nIt was too late though for me. Having graduated with a marketing degree, I know this first thing about marketing is to keep the customers happy. Angry customers can only lead to trouble. By the time the hotel finally connected the dots too many people were mad. \\n\\nOverall this is a very long way of saying Rio needs to remember that at the end of the day, if the customer isn't happy: you aren't doing your job.",

Definitely not one of those thriftier lunches at around $25 with tip, but it's not often I treat myself to raw vegan deliciousness.  \\n\\nMy advice is to not expect a typical lasagna because you'll surely be disappointed.  It's more like a generous pat of creamy nuts, raw tomato paste, and herbs (I tasted mint).  The raw zucchini isn't very flavorful itself, the tomato was probably the most potent flavor.  I love tomato of all kinds, so I was rather fond of the Lunasagna.  The raw lasagna I had forever ago in Austin may have been tastier but this was a perfect lunch and fueled me along for a rather busy day.  The accompanying side salad was pretty great as well, but I think the it was the amazing salad dressing that in fact won me over.\\n\\nSo here's a tip, the cookies consists mainly of coconut, so if you hate coconut, stay far far away.

Not good at all.   I work at one of the best sushi restaurants in Scottsdale, so I didn't even bother trying the sushi. TOYAMA restaurant= best sushi in the valley. Hidden gem.   We heard the table next to us rave about the tres leches cake so we decided to get it. One of the worst tres leches I've ever had.  Gooey marshmallow on top of the cake, with chewy old tasting chocolate rice Krispy treats, in a nasty condensed milk/tapioca flavored sauce.  Whoever came up with this dessert has the palate of a 10 year old.  Not very sophisticated flavors. Will not be returning.  You want good Mexican food, go to the Mission in old town Scottsdale, or the barrio cafe in Phoenix. You want good Asian food, come visit me at Toyama. You want the worst of both worlds, go to sumomaya.",

I'm a gringa and I know that don't look right and I could do a way better job. The rice was missing completely and there was only one giant pizza pie looking tortilla.

While I love rock music, it was not befitting to the supposed theme of Rawhide. There were even timeshare vendors and massage chair kiosks set-up in the town! We ate in the steak house since the BBQ selection was minimal and the line was extremely long, about 40 plus. My fiance had to return his \\\"\"smoked\\\"\" chicken because it was very mushy.

In Japanese we say \\\"\"hatsukoi\\\"\" which means first love. Though technically you aren't my first love, you are now. I must thank fellow Yelper Dave F., for bringing us together. If it wasn't for him suggesting I give you a try, we would've never met. \\n\\nMy friends aren't Yelpers and when I told them about you, they weren't exactly thrilled. You see, they don't get the concept of Yelp. Which doesn't quite make much sense to me since they always ask me to jump on my app when they have no idea where to eat at. Of course the girl with the Yelp app to the rescue. \\n\\nAfter perusing some reviews and reading them out loud to them, they agreed to go. Don't tell but I skipped over the long wait part and only highlighted the good. I knew I had to remain mum about possible waits up to 2 hours. My one & only mission was to just get them there. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, the counter was full with 2 people in line. I was hopeful. There were 3 of us, we had left the others at the hotel since they were too hungover to join us. Totally well played. The best part was, as soon as we stepped in line, 5 people got up! We didn't have to wait a single minute! The stars, the moon, the universe, everything aligned perfectly. \\n\\nI ordered the Pan Roast Lobster and this is where my love affair began. The friendly waitress suggested the heat level at 6. Since it was busy, we probably waited about 20 mins, maybe a bit longer but it didn't seem long. I was fascinated with the lone cook who was creating dish after dish in front of me. He was like the energizer bunny, zipping around in that small space. \\n\\nWhen he finally placed the ginormous bowl in front of me, my eyes sparkled. Huge generous amounts of lobster were floating in my bowl. Then I took that first bite. My mouth exploded with flavors. I don't even think I can find the right words to convey how delicious my pan roast was. It was total perfection. From the level 6 heat to the scrumptious lobster to the lobster bisqu\\u00e9 sauce even the scoop of white rice that was in my bowl. My eyes were now in the shape of hearts as I gazed at you. My heart fluttered, I was officially in love. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the seafood pan roast and another the shrimp scampi (which came with pasta) and though we all tried each others. I can say unequivocally hands down, mine was the best. \\n\\nThe portions were so generous that none of us could finish our meal. One friend suggested on our next visit there, we should share. Huh? Huh? What? Did I just hear that correctly? Was he skirting around the issue that Yelp and Dave F., is what brought us there? \\n\\nI must give kudos to your chef and waitress. Both were consistently busy taking orders, clearing off counter space, preparing each order, opening raw oysters or clams with such ease, and refilling drinks. All of this while engaging people in friendly conversation and a smile. \\n\\nI know some patrons complain about lack of counter space with only about 20 seats but I hope you don't expand. I love the ambiance and the intimacy. Even though you're in the casino with no walls separating you from the rest of the world, you wouldn't even know it since one is more focused on the activity in front of them and of course the delish food. \\n\\nWhen I go back to Vegas, believe me, I will definitely visit my first love. And to you sir Dave F., arigatou, merci beacoup, kamsanmida, gracious, danke. You are the bomb! \\n\\nP.S. I would wait in line a million years to eat here again. Don't let the wait put you off.

I got a groupon online and decided to give it another try even though I wasn't thrilled the first time.  They forgot to put pepperoni on our pizza.  When I alerted the waitress to the forgotten pepperoni, she immediately ran in the back without saying anything. She came back out and said \\\"\"you're right\\\"\". I definitely felt like she should have just apologized right away, not gone in back to check that I had in fact ordered pepperoni. Then, the bill came. Pepperoni was still charged!  I didn't even say anything because we had been sitting there for over an hour and I just wanted to leave.  \\n\\nFor a gross tasteless pizza and 2 soft drinks it was almost $30.

After watching people leave and having them sit at least 6 smaller groups (including a party of 3 who just walked in at a table for 4!), I asked what was going on. The girl at the register did not know what to say to us and had the manager/part owner come talk to us. As he walked over to us, his face told me that we were bothering him, like he was annoyed. He came over to tell us it would be longer! I asked why they hadn't put the two tables together or pull up a 5th chair to a table and he looked around the room and said \\\"\"where?\\\"\" I thought, Hello! You have been seating group after group ahead of us at the tables so yeah, they're not available anymore! He started getting very defensive though I asked without offense. I had invested time, we were starving and I just wanted to sit down already. After being there so long with my handicapped nephew, my mother and my kids and being treated like we didn't matter, we just left. His attitude, lack of professionalism and lack of ability to deal with customers was just too much. They couldn't find room for a party of 5 people and pretty much told us tough luck!

Salted cured meat, wrapped in filo-dough, deep fried, and served with a house made thousand island sauce. Seriously, this goes great with a solid IPA.\\n\\nThe final thing I decided on was the calamari. This comes in a bowl with pickled seaweed. (I'm not sure about that?)

Once we saw the small plaza where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located, we said to each other that there was no way we would have found this place just by driving by because you just don't \\\"\"drive by\\\"\" the area where Basil & Garlic Bistro was located.\\n\\nOnto the food. it was all amazing.  The chicken steak deluxe has a wonderful mixture of meat, veggies, and cheese.  There was a HUGE chunk of pepperoni in each half of the sandwich and my fiancee commented that \\\"\"this is the amount of pepperoni some places put on an entire pizza!\\\"\"  My fiancee's Vongole pasta with red sauce and clams was one of the better pasta dishes we've ever had, anywhere. And it was only $14, definitely a great deal because you're at a family owned establishment in a local neighborhood.  We finished off the meal with homemade tiramisu which was not overly sweet and did not have an overdosing of rum.  It was decorated with drizzles of chocolate sauce and cocoa powder with bits of whip cream on the side.\\n\\nI come to Phoenix every so often for work and would definitely count Basil & Garlic Bistro as the place I'd try to come out to for dinner when my schedule allows me to make the drive out there.",

I went when it first opened, I had been anxiously waiting for it since I had tried Megan Romano's desserts at Aureole. \\n\\nWe went there for breakfast wanting to try a bunch of things, chose a breakfast sandwich and a quiche as well as a blackberry scone and gelato. The space is decorated really nice and you can tell a lot of thought went into the details. Everybody that works there is really nice too. Anywho, the breakfast items and pastry were ok, nothing out of this world. I thought the scone was kind of dry in fact. But the gelato was OUT OF THIS WORLD! We tried grapefruit and strawberry and they were incredible, the taste was so pure! It was like taking a bite out of the freshest fruit out there!\\n\\nOn my most recent visit I went in the evening (they are open til 7 so that's a major plus) for the sole purpose of getting my husband a treat. I ended up getting some bon bons, truffles, chocolate-covered graham crackers and oreos. In theory, they were all for my husband but since I purchased two of each, I decided when I got home to try one. OMG! I ended up trying one of each and let me tell you, they were all FANTASTIC! This is some seriously good chocolate folks. It is on the pricey side, 1.50-2 dollars a piece but well worth it. I think if they were cheaper I would end up buying 20 pieces and eating them all by myself! So tis way, you feel like it's a treat to eat and you don't devour it. You are able to savor each bite.

Every time I come to Surco, there is a different waitstaff. And the last time I went (about a month ago), the service was terrible. The food took way way way too long and there were only three tables full in the restaurant. The server was super awkward (I felt bad for the fella). It may have been his first night waiting tables ever. Our entire party of 4 was very hungry and we had to wait about 45 minutes for any food to come out. Even stranger, we ordered 2 plates of ceviche, and they came out last. You'd think that if you were making your customers wait ~45 minutes for an appetizer, you might just wanna serve them their ceviche first. It's cured fish. It's been curing for like... at least 24 hours, so it's not like it takes much time to prep. But no. We waited, got our causitas (tasted amazing), and then got our entrees. By the time everyone was full from their entrees, our ceviche still hadn't come out. So I approached the waiter and asked to cancel one of our ceviche orders. I realize it's kind of a bitch move to do, but we had already been at the restaurant for almost two hours. Everyone was full and still kind of cranky from having to wait so long. So at this point, we all kind of wanted to go home. More importantly, if I'm canceling an order of something, what I'm really saying is \\\"\"I don't want to pay for this.\\\"\" But apparently it was too late to cancel, so we got and paid for the two orders of ceviche.\\n\\nTLDR; four stars for food. one star for service. but I have to give a two star rating overall because the service was THAT bad. get your shit together, Surco, because you have the potential to be something great. get some waiters who know what they're doing and actually know how to speak to people without shaking from nervousness. also, make sure they know how to pour the effing water. and play music in your restaurant so your customers have something to do while they're waiting an hour for appetizers. kthx bye!",

After months (more than a year?) of delays, the sister restaurant to the legendary Point Brugge Cafe (Point Breeze) has finally opened.  Grand opening on Tuesday 1 February, but a \\\"\"soft opening\\\"\" was announced to the Highland Park neighbors earlier this week.\\n\\nAs you might expect if you've ever seen the reviews of Point Brugge Cafe, Pittsburgh now has another terrific fresh-food restaurant!  And another feather in the restaurant cap for Bryant Street and Highland Park.\\n\\nThe decor is contemporary -- sleek and simple -- but very comfortable.  It's a boisterous place (some might call it \\\"\"noisy\\\"\") so if you're looking for dark, quiet, romantic dinner, this ain't the place for you.  If, however, you're looking for great food in an energized environment, this could your new dining \\\"\"home.\\\"\"   \\n\\nI wish I could offer a more extended sense of the menu, but my wife and I both ordered the same thing.  \\n\\nWe started with a potato/pancetta soup.  It was broth-based, but with just a touch of cream to hold it together.  Light and delicious.\\n\\nOur entree: herb-crusted salmon over arugula and lentils.  In spite of the fact that we ordered the salmon well-done (not fans of raw fish), the salmon was moist and tasty.   The arugula and lentils were wonderful.  \\n\\nFor dessert, we shared an order of profiteroles: three crisp, hollow rounds of pastries filled with ice cream and drizzled in chocolate and, I believe, a bit of caramel.  Again, very flavorful.   Not a fan of chocolate, but whatever they drizzled on the profiteroles was particularly tasty.\\n\\nFor fans of Point Brugge, the menu includes the steamed P.E.I. mussels and Belgain-style twice-cooked fries with seasoned mayonnaise.  (The family at the table next to us went through two orders of EACH!)\\n\\nThe service was very good even though it was the first night with customers.  I was told that the cafe hired EXPERIENCED servers, host staff and bartenders.  Congrats to them for thinking through this.  \\n\\nTo repeat: another tremendous addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene and ESPECIALLY to fans of good, fresh food who live in the East End.\\n\\nMy only disappointment was that I couldn't get an espresso after dinner.  Only traditional American coffee (though it IS PrestoGeorge coffee).

So I gassed up the ride, put on some Mr. Bean in the DVD player, microwaved some popcorn, put out a couple Klondike Bars (hmmm...what wouldn't I do for a Klondike Bar?), and said \\\"\"Later, kids!\\\"\"  And we were off!  Although, thinking back I think I forgot to leave another phone number in case of emergencies.  Luckily, everything was fine when we got back home.  Except the funny English accent my little one gave me upon our arrival (thanks Mr. Bean).\\n\\nFamous Dave's interior is really...decorated.  This place is like the Disneyland of BBQ!  There's stuff everywhere, I guess this is what it's like to come to a corporate BBQ!  Nothing like those down home places where all you smell is smoke, the walls are dingy, and the chairs are rickety.  Looks like Dave's been making a healthy buck on his 'que.  But the place was inviting nonetheless.  \\n\\nFamous Dave's has a good menu that includes lots of appetizers, salads, burgers, sandwiches, soups, and BBQ combos.  But we were there for one thing only, the infamous 'Que for Two' for $19.99!  Sorry, payday wasn't until the next week and it was all we could afford.  Hard times I tell ya!  Upon ordering this from our server with some cold drinks, he was on his way.  20 minutes later our BBQ bliss had arrived.\\n\\nI heard from co-workers that the Que for Two wasn't enough for two people and that I would be hungry afterwards.  Me being a 'husky' sized Asian boy was a little let down upon hearing this.  But when our platter arrived, I sure wasn't disappointed!  There was more than enough food for two!  We had four of Dave's 'Famous' ribs, 1/2 a BBQ chicken, 1/2 a serving of chopped pork+1/2 a serving of beef brisket (I couldn't decide on which one so I asked for both..ha ha), Famous Fries, two cornbread muffins, and a side of garlic red skin mashed potatoes.  I gotta tell ya'...it was all pretty good!  The ribs were moist, flavored well, and cooked just right with a tiny bit of bite in em'.  The chopped pork and the brisket were very good too, and tender.  But the biggest surprise for me was the chicken.  Often times chicken can get dry in a BBQ pit but this one was super succulent and moist, and the rub was great.  This was my fav of the night.  And it was all so good with their sauces!  I liked all six of them but my favs were their original Rich & Sassy, Sweet & Zesty, and the Devil's Spit (sucker is spicy hot!).  Service was good, our server kept up with us and kept us stocked with wet naps and our drinks full.  \\n\\nNext time, I'm taking the kids with us and we're so gonna have the All-American BBQ Feast...old school and served on a trash can lid!  The lid is lined with paper...of course.  I saw it that night on a table...and the sucker is HUGE!  It can easily feed four people...unless you're a mighty Samoan...then this would be considered your 'Que for Two'.  \\n\\nWe had enough food leftover to take a doggie bag home for the kids.  Admittedly, I finished the last rib that night as a midnight snack.  But I did leave the fries for them!  But I did also manage to finish the little one's Klondike Bar.  Boy, am I a big lil' piggy.",

The room is warm and dark, offering up a relaxing atmosphere largely due to the rich, warm wood.\\n\\nWe were presented with the Grande Mojito.\\n\\nOur instructor and mixologist, Monique Dias, was so enthusiastic and full of information regarding all facets of muddling.  It was not only an enjoyable experience, but an interesting history lesson of sorts.  Tasty too!\\n\\nWe were able to sample the Grande as well as the Berry Grande Mojitos.  While both were delicious and I rather enjoyed the introduction of fruit, I am partial to the original version.\\n\\nAfter our Muddling Course was complete we were lead to \\\"\"the rail\\\"\".  The Rail overlooks the open kitchen.  I have to say, if given a choice of dining at a table in the main room or at The Rail, I would always choose the rail.  I couldn't imagine all the things you would be able to see on a busy night, not to mention the tips one could pick up just by being in the presence of these amazing chefs!  Chef Rodriguez treated us to an in-depth lesson in all things ceviche.  I was amazed at the amount of information that he knew and shared with us.  (I won't spill it all, since I really want you to check out deseo and The Rail and have your experience not be tainted by mine!)\\n\\nOur first indulgence was the Rainbow Ceviche, a beautifully presented dish featuring tuna, salmon and hamachi dressed with white soy, citrus, sesame seeds and pickled jalapeno.  In short - it was amazing and my hands-down favorite of the three ceviches of the night.  It was so fresh and light and the slight punch of the pickled jalapenos was unexpected yet welcomed.\\n\\nNext up we had the Lobster Escabeche which was a delicate ceviche served with avocado, chives, sweet aji and garlic chips.  This is not what you think of when you hear \\\"\"ceviche\\\"\".  It was delicate yet rich.  Beautifully presented and a treat to my mouth!\\n\\nWe completed the trio with the Ceviche Mixto Clasico, full of lobster, shrimp, scallops, calamari, octopus, crab, red onion and an accompaniment of sweet potato.  What a decadent way to round out the tasting.\\n\\nPrior to being served our entrees, Chef Rodriguez spread some holiday cheer by treating all of our guests to a personalized autographed copy of his most recent book, The Great Ceviche Book, revised. This book will provide you a bounty of information and instruction as well as hints and tips to create an array of ceviches!  This was such a wonderful treat to our guests and we were blown away by his generosity.\\n\\nAfter we calmed down from the excitement, is was time for our entrees.  We were served a split plate of tender beef tenderloin and merluza sea bass and fideo.  The contrast of flavors and textures of these two dishes was complex and only lent to the entire experience of the evening.\\n\\nOverall - this event, having been our first to co-host - will be close to impossible to beat.

My sister and fiance are both servers and they were with me this day as well as a couple other friends. We were seated right away in an empty back section of the restaurant. I go to the bathroom and come back and my party is gone? Our table was moved because oops! No one's working that section of the restaurant. \\n\\nIt took over 20 minutes just to get our drink order taken. We had a couple people stop by and say, someone will be right with you, someone will be right with you. We finally had another server stop by and start to take our drink order. People who had arrived after us were getting their drinks and salads already. Since we'd been waiting forever at this point someone said can we just go ahead and order while we're at it? And started placing their order. By the time the waitress got around to the last person (my sister) she was very impatient. Since my sister had some questions about the menu she started asking some polite questions (What comes with this dish? Can I sub this for that?) The waitress literally said \\\"\"Could you please hurry up? I have other tables to wait on.\\\"\" My sister sat there with her mouth open, flabbergasted that someone would be that rude to her especially since we were getting crappy service already. \\n\\nBy the time the rude waitress (I think her name was Bobby?) finally got our order in and it came out (forever later, no refills on drinks) my order of 1/2 lb. hamburger was wrong and I got a hamburger steak? I think they just took it to the back and put a bun on it but I don't care, I was hungry. My fiance finally gets up to get a manager to explain the extremely lousy and rude service we received and we ended up getting the entire 5 meals comp'd. I don't think we saw our \\\"\"actual\\\"\" server the entire time we were there. The oddest thing about this whole thing is that the restaurant wasn't even busy. They had sections closed off. Our waitress had only 5 tables or so seated during the time we were there.  We ended up tipping the hostess a couple bucks because she was the only person who competently (not that there's much competition here) did her job. \\n\\nToo long, didn't read version: If you go to this Cracker Barrel make sure you get a good server and if it starts to take more than 10 minutes to get your drink order taken, you should consider leaving before you even start.

And you don't get a free side unless you buy 3 tacos, otherwise they run about $2.50.  I had a side of rice which probably wouldn't have filled up my hand.  I get that they are quality local ingredients, but I feel like the markup is a little ridiculous.  If you have a large appetite and a small budget, I DO NOT recommend Taco Guild.

I'm not sure if you can call it a 'district', but it's the closest thing Vegas has to what outsiders and new residents refer to as 'culture'.  The streets are blocked off and food vendors, art vendors, galleries, and music stages pepper the surrounding area......think of a massive block party or small festival.\\n\\nI enjoy coming down here with the family from time to time to check out the scene.  It gets really crowded, so it's difficult to really appreciate the art if you're into a more quiet and calm setting like I am.  One First Friday I saw a guy smoking inside the Arts Factory gallery.....that's crazy, the smoke can ruin the artwork!  Of course, nobody said anything to him.....and when I mentioned it, he gave me a \\\"\"who the F___ are you?!\\\"\" look and walked away.  *sigh*  Some people come to First Friday for the party and not the art.....that's cool, but not really my style.\\n\\nThere's a lot of local musicians represented down here and a few stages where they perform.....it's kind of cool to see local bands perform since there aren't too many places in Vegas to listen to them.  There's usually a few food trucks and concession stands as well as restaurants down here.  We rarely eat at the event though as the lines can get very long and we don't really enjoy our meals when there's nowhere to sit and enjoy the food.  Definitely worth a trip if you've never been before though.\\n\\nSome TIPS:\\n\\n- Parking is very difficult to find.  There is paid valet parking at the Arts Factory on the corner of Charleston & Main St, but it fills up quickly.  Street parking close to the event is sometimes hard to find too.....my recommendation is to get there early or be patient to find a spot.\\n\\n- Wear comfortable shoes.  The First Friday event covers a few city blocks, so if you want to get the full experience be prepared to walk.\\n\\n- Bathrooms are a premium.  Because of the large crowds, expect long waits at the restroom.  The Arts Factory has one, some of the smaller galleries around the area won't let you use their private bathroom....keep that in mind.\\n\\n- If you bring your kids, make sure you keep an eye on them.  It's easy to lose them in the crowd and remember that you're on the streets of Downtown Las Vegas.....not a cool place to lose your kid at night.\\n\\nOverall, it's a pretty cool experience if you know what to expect.\\n\\nReturn Factor - 80%",

All the animals were tired, hot and sleeping. They looked miserable and we were miserable too. The water mists did not help one bit.\\n\\nWe also went this past weekend when the temperature was a high of 76 degrees. Heaven!!! Loved the zoo. Had so much fun. No need to rush. We just relaxed. All the kids were in a great mood. People were smiling, laughing, just having plain ol fun. The animals seemed alive and active. Just a beautiful experience. The Arizona Trail is great. It might have been good to go there with the hot temperatures as well. Some animals are hard to see because of the layout in the cages. The cages are smaller than needed for some of these large cats and other wild life. The Orangutans have a little baby Orangutan in it and he just hangs and plays while the big guys sleep. It was really cool. My favorite part is the giraffes. There were 5 of them this last time.",

And now the details...\\nWe made the mistake of not looking up this store on Yelp when we happened by it after going elsewhere in the same shopping center (The Dump).  We found a kitchen table that fit the bill for the size we had in mind.  We had a very friendly salesman and worked out a price that we could stomach and purchased the set.  Next, how to get this set into our kitchen.  We had two options: 1. have it delivered for a fee or 2. pick it up.  Well, I had a vehicle large enough to accommodate the set, so I wanted to do that.  What's that you say?  I have to go way out to the Avenues to pick it up?  Hogwash!  We opted to pay delivery and not have to don our Kevlar vests to make the pickup.  (OK, I favor the East Valley- sue me).  \\nThat is where things went sideways.  \\nThe \\\"\"warehouse\\\"\" folks did not call the day before our scheduled delivery, which concerned me as that was the one thing I was promised as the time was a range.  No call within a couple hours of delivery so I called the store, who got me the warehouse number.  When I called, I was told that the set was on the truck and on the way.  I confirmed the address and they had the wrong name AND address.  They were trying to deliver my set to some guy out in the WV.  They rerouted the truck and they eventually arrived after 5:00PM when we had a morning delivery scheduled.  \\nUpon assembly, they quickly left and we took some time to inspect the merchandise.  There were two issues: 1. one chair wobbled due to a leg being about 1/2\\\"\" shorter than the rest.  The second issue was in relation to a bench that came with the set.  It had a upholstered seat and it appeared a box had been placed on it, leaving a depression that was pretty severe.  We gave it 24 hours to even out, but it didn't.  We then called the warehouse and were asked by a skeptical sounding lady to text her pictures of the bench so she can make sure ACME (the manufacturer) would do a replacement.  Instead, we stopped by the store to let them know the issues we had with the delivery.  The customer service manager was very friendly and helpful.  He ordered new legs for the chair and another bench.  The legs came into the store, and I picked those up but there would be a wait for the bench.  Again, they did not call to confirm the delivery window when the promised date arrived.  When I called the warehouse to confirm again, I was told that they ALWAYS call.  I begged to differ but again, she was skeptical.  By the time we got the replacement bench delivered, nearly a month had passed since the original purchase.  Notably, the new bench cushions looked a little different than the other (it was much less loosely covered).\\n\\nOverall, the store experience was decent (at least I was told what they thought that I wanted to hear), the product quality was mediocre but the delivery process and warehouse employee made me want to...write a review on Yelp.",

She took our order so quick and abrupt that it was almost like if you didn't have a quick answer for her, she would yell at you!

It was close to our friends hotel so we thought lets check it out, I hadn't been in awhile.  \\n\\nThe Good: \\nI've been here several times over the last 12 years of living in Phoenix and one thing I have to say is this restaurant is very consistent with their food.  It's always good, and when you order something you know what you are going to get.  A sandwich I had 4-6 years ago, tastes as good today as it did back then. \\n \\nThe Bad: \\nIt's not really bad, but to best honest, I think its time for a little make over.  It's one thing to be consistent but this restaurant needs to catch up with its competition.  There are many many new restaurants in the valley, especially in the Scottsdale area and to the locals this can get boring.  This place hasn't changed in about 10 years, I think its time for a freshen up.  \\nOverall, its a great place that brings back many memories from coming here over the years, and I look forward to coming back again.",

Of course, there was about a 1:1 ratio server to guests so....\\n\\nThis place is not doing very well so I do feel bad, however, there are some obvious reasons.  The prices are very high and the portions are not very big.  So for the amount of food you get, the items are very overpriced.  Burgers, skewers, sandwiches and salads are all around 10, pizzas between 10-15.  Everything is a la carte and you get about 3 appetizer size skewers for the entrees.  Appetizers are about 10 as well, and desserts are 7 even with the option to add ice cream for 1.  \\n\\nI will say the burgers are better than the Grind - they actually stay together!  (the bun falls apart easily at the Grind and makes eating hard after a couple bites).  The fries were good ($5).  The pork skewers were passable but nothing special.  The Dorito potato skins were nothing special - just had a wedge of cheesy chip stuck in the middle of it.  The cupcake was good, but the chocolate was a little grainy.

Everyone should do it once to see how crazy Vegas is on Sundays but glad I didn't spend my money for it! I forget to mention they pat you down like TSA......hmmmm what is up. I imagine they have had problems in the past. Like gangs & fights! Then security kept telling this guy no gym shorts & he pushes his way past them saying I know. WTF?

The choice of beers was excellent with Guinness, Boddingtons etc etc. Service was fast and the menu is slick and to the point. There wasn't pages and pages of dishes which is so off putting when you only have a short lunch break. Plenty of British traditions such as Fish and Chips, Bangers and Mash, Ploughmans, and good old indian curry. \\n\\nWe ordered the Highland burger with french fries and also the Tikka Masala curry with naan bread. I was asked how I liked my burger cooked which was a surprise to hear for a lunchtime pub so after this question I expected a great burger. Much to say, I was very disappointed. The burger was tiny within a huge bun. It literally sat in the middle like a meatball while the bun remained soggy. It was difficult to pick up and fell apart. The meat was very dry, almost like it was reheated rather than freshly cooked. The tikka masala curry was also very dry, like it was cooked and then reheated in the microwave. There wasn't any moisture in the sauce at all more-so like curry paste stuck to the chicken. \\n\\nI must say though the french fries that came with the burger were the best I had ever had and their homemade sauce was excellent. \\n\\nHowever $45 for two lunch main dishes, a pint of Guinness and a panache was too much especially for the overly cooked and very dry food.",

So my friends and I got all dolled up thinking that we would get some promoter's attention which basically worked everywhere but here. We were like, alright, cute asian girls.. alas NO. One of my friends actually spotted someone who looked like a promoter (and turned out to be one) who put us on the list probably cuz we asked. \\n\\nAfter getting there, we realized why we probably were not approached - this is completely not our scene. Unfortunately we're not so into euro-techno music and people were not at dressed up as we thought they would be. \\n\\nWhen we got there this big promoter guy told us to just hang out near one of the velvet ropes because we were on the list. He wasn't really clear and put us in a line with a group of guys. After a while he saw that we were standing in the wrong place and then finally let us in. \\n\\nWe got in the club and man.. it was kind of boring from the get go. We decided we would get our drinks, down it and hop over to Tao. Too bad we weren't more drunk at that time because maybe we would have stayed, but our intense sobriety warned as against that. As we tried to leave, some guy told us to go another way. Well, liar, it wasn't another way... it was another room where a crowd of people were just standing there watching half naked girls dance. I'm not sure what impression we gave that guy, but I could have sworn we had the desperate-to-get-out-here look, not the we-want-to-look-at-other-girls-dance look. \\n\\nAt least in the end we made it out and over to Tao where we definitely had a much more exciting night (aka VIP, patron, belvedere, fun)",

But it was packed and probably resulted in the poor and sloppy service we got.\\n\\nGot drinks at the bar and got seated and got special guac that had pomegranate arils in it. The pomegranate did add a nice splash of tang to the guac, only problem I had was that this tableside guac was 11 bucks and the server just used one of the prep bowls to combine everything; we ended up with a bowl with about two ice cream scoops worth of guac and Im trying not to exaggerate. For eleven bucks I should at least get a bowl bigger than what the onions and cilantro came in.\\n\\nNext was the queso fundido. At first glance we saw a small pool of water and grease so we decided to mix it thoroughly. The cheeses, onion, chorizo, and seasoning was on point, but half the dish was a watery pool and the other half was a stringy mess like pulling a slice off a good pizza: except this was supposed to be a dip. I was expecting a consistency of nacho cheese, where when you pull the chip off, the cheese falls in ribbons back to the tray, absorbing back into the mothership. My cousin said this might just be what queso fundido is, as we both never had it before. I don't know, you tell me, I honestly think that the cheeses weren't completely incorporated yet when they served it. \\n\\nI got the cochinita pibil tres tacos. The tortillas didn't taste heated up, and it ended up pretty starchy and grainy with the pork, which was seasoned with nice sour pickled veggies, but no sauce. Should've asked for hot sauce! The fries were okay, not really spicy, but the hot ketchup was good.\\n\\nMy cousin had a filet mignon torta and we first noticed that the bottom bun was soaked in the sauce which was slathered on part of the plate. So soggy bun and decent meat was going to be okkkkk, until we tasted that they didnt reduce the alcohol in the sauce enough and it was a real mismatch with the meat. :/ I'm sure it is a good sauce, had they weren't been so busy and overlooked our table.\\n\\nI am afraid to say that this socal boy tried to salvedge this meal by making my own dish: carnitas fries with salsa, pickled vegetables, and hot ketchup.

We saw this restaurant featured on Check Please Arizona and being from the south, we were excited to try it.  I decided to take my husband there for his birthday.  Let me start off with the review of the food - it was terrible.  The chicken was greasy, and had no flavor.  The sides were as bad as a school cafeteria.  But the service is even worse!  We arrived around 1:30 on a Saturday.  There were 2 large tables of people and a few other tables but still lots of empty tables (the place is pretty small).  We chose a table in the back - huge mistake, because it reeked of the smells from the bathroom.  But I wanted to try to stay positive since it was my husband's birthday.  We waited only a few minutes before a waiter came by to give us menus and get our drink order.  We ordered non-sweet tea - however, we got one sweet and one non-sweet, we were able to get that remedied, but when the waiter came back to give us the tea, he wouldn't take our order even though we said we were ready.  He said he had to get a pencil and paper and would be back. Well, he didn't come back for almost 45 minutes!  That's not to say he wasn't around, when the large table's food was ready, the brought out the plates one by one - several minutes apart.  Several other tables came in during this time, while we were still waiting to order, he actually took he new tables orders before ours!  Finally, I spoke up next time he was in our vicinity and told him we still hadn't ordered.  Even after this, it took him about 10 minutes to come back!  We should have walked out, but now it was a mission to see how long it would take.  After we ordered, we waited again.  At some point, a man came out and asked a table near us, but who had came in well after us, how long they had been waiting, and this nice lady told him that our table had been waiting longer than hers.  Turns out, they got their food before we did!  In fact several tables that came in after us got food before us.  Finally, we got our food and let me say that I have had better fried chicken from KFC - I actually think they might have gotten the chicken from KFC, because I don't remember the smell of chicken frying in the restaurant.  And of course they got our sides wrong.  At the end of our meal, a lady came by again to the table near us and apologized for the delay and asked if she could provide a dessert on the house, again the nice lady customer informed the employee that in fact we had been there much longer than them, The employee then just looked at us and reluctantly came to our table and asked us if we wanted dessert.  Having lived in the south, I am familiar with racial tensions, and I have read the other Yelpers mentioning the disparity of service for non-dark customers, this place is worse than anything I have ever experienced.  Two hours waiting for a lunchtime meal!  That's CRAZY!  I felt unwelcome and unimportant to the business.  I will never go there again.  And after all of that, it was $34.00!!  Maybe they charge by the number of minutes you occupy the table?  I think I owe my husband another birthday dinner....",

Now I have changed my review because they have continually disappointed me.  They never seem to get my eggs cooked the way I like them.  The corn beef hash use to be fresh and plentiful and now they are skimpy and dry.  The bacon (use to give 4 and now only 3?) my husband ordered was greasy and not crispy.  He likes his toast to be well toasted and they brought them out completely burnt.  It was sent back and all they did was scrape some of the burnt off the toast.  Our eggs were either underdone or overcooked.   They didn't even look appetizing.  The last time we were there the manager saw what was happening but didn't even come to our table to apologize.   So disappointing each time and we kept giving them another chance.  Their quantity and quality has gone down.  Most plates being fairly pricey at 10 bucks a plate for breakfast,  we think now its not worth it. Their motto \\\"\"fresh and fast\\\"\",  I think NOT.",

Perhaps it is the fact that I haven't tried any good ones or perhaps its the fact that I have just been trying all the bad ones. Either or they are one in the same because every time I have come here I have been disappointed. Here is the break down of the stars given.\\n\\nStar 1:\\nThe Service: I gave this a star because despite the drinks here being bland the people working here are absolutely not in the slightest. They have always been courteous and full of smiles. They are always prompt with making my drinks and very friendly.\\n\\nStar 2:\\nThe Atmosphere: This place is a wonderful place to be whether you came to chat with your friends, study, or just read a book. There is no pressure to leave and there are many different types of seats in this place. A comfortable couch to read on, a sturdy chair to study in, or outside patio chairs for the cool evenings. \\n\\nStar 3:\\nThe Location: Being next to the 101 freeway is always a plus due to easy travel. I can easily go from work to this place and then back home. All I have in my area is a dunkin doughnuts and to be honest you don't go their for lattes.\\n\\nOn the flip side, here are why the other two stars were not given.\\n\\n1: The drinks: As I mentioned before I was sorely disappointed with the drinks here. My first drink here was the Carmel latte and to be honest I thought I was going to get a blood clot because of how sweet it was. It was so sweet that I only could take a couple sips and then had to throw it away. My second drink was some type of ice tea. I love ice tea, but when I drank this it was so bitter I had to force myself to drink it all just to feel that I didn't waste my money. Finally, the last drink i got was the Chai Tea Latte. All I can say is that it tasted like a Chai Tea Latte that sat out in the sun for about 10 minutes and served. It was so watered down and unpleasant I just drank it as fast as I could and left it at that. \\n\\n2: The prices. When I look at the cost of some of these things I find myself a little in awe. How could such simple concoctions of sugar, power, coffee, and milk be so expensive? My chai tea was almost $5 with tax and it was tiny!\\n\\nDespite the disappointing drinks I think i keep coming back because of the atmosphere of the place. Hopefully I can find something to drink soon that is good, or I might have to start looking for another coffee shop.

I was told that if I got there in the next half hour to an hour, they'd be able to seat my party no problem.  20 minutes later, we walked in and were told they only had room at the bar (the place was pretty empty, so I got the message: make a reservation and don't trust anyone's estimation).\\n\\nThe next time I went, with a confirmed reservation, the service was good.  My crab-stuffed mushroom tapas dish was visually appealing and full of great ingredients...except for the crab itself.  I don't know the cause, but it was bland and barely tasted like crab.  Everything else on the plate, especially the sauce, was delicious, so it averaged out to not bad, despite my disappointment with the starring ingredient.\\n\\nThe paella took forever to come out, but it came out hot (meaning the kitchen was slow, not the server).  Most of it was delicious.  The chorizo pieces just tasted like a hot dog (a good hot dog, mind you, but more hot dog than spicy Mediterranean sausage for sure).  The rice was a little undercooked.  But everything else was good or better (much of it great).\\n\\nI wasn't drinking that night, but had I been, I would have been disappointed.  They were out of more than a few selections, preventing the creation of entire sections of the drinks menu (example: no mojitos that night).  Apparently such alcohol shortages are a common occurrence.\\n\\nI'd say this place has a lot of potential, because though many things were sub-par, they're almost all easily fixed.  Knowing what to expect, I'd definitely consider returning (though it wouldn't usually be my first choice).",

A few things on the menu I'm not sure what they are but they also do a Korean Style sushi that is wrapped in lettuce.\\n\\nWhen we stopped in we were greeted by the most enthusiastic happy person. We were taking a little time to decide and she gave us miso soup so I don't know if it comes with thee meal or not. We ordered a variety to share and ordered the two pick bento box some sushi and a specialty roll.\\n\\nThe Mackerel in the bento box really WOWED me. It was the most delicious mackerel I ever had. The fish was sweet and fresh and seasoned so tasty anybody would like it even if you hate fish you will like it. The salad was dressed with a creamy sesame dressing and the spicy tuna rolls were rolled just right and were fresh. \\n\\nThey don't have the biggest selection of rolls and many have cream cheese or are fried and that is why I didn't give five stars based on one visit. I tried the Salmon with garlic sauce roll. It was rolled very carefully and was a very good fish to rice ratio. The fish seemed very fresh and the sauce really made it taste good. I do note this roll had cream cheese in it and I might have missed seeing that on the menu.\\n\\nThis isn't a fancy place and is very small and opened in a previous sushi restaurant location using the same old sushi sign but this is a completely new restaurant in an older strip mall.\\n\\nThey also do reasonably priced all day happy hour rolls ($3 - $7)\\n\\nNext time I might try the Korean Sushi and have some soju here!\\n\\n4.5 Stars",

        "ori": "There are so many things wrong with this gym that I could probably write a small book on its gross lack of customer service and inattentiveness to detail, but I'll try to sum it up in under 20 paragraphs.\\n\\nPF puts far more emphasis on the customer it's trying to court than the one it already has. Basically, a sell-sell-sell attitude. Once you are a member, you're nothing to them anymore.\\n\\n-I've tried to get the tv put on to no avail sometimes. PF has numerous tvs and often a big game will be showing where people are doing cardio but where people (moslty men) are lifting free weights, we'll get news or golf. \\\"\"I don't know how to work the tv\\\"\" or \\\"\"I'll ask someone to do it\\\"\" are popular responses. I've even been turned down trying to get an ASU game on and that's the local team. Disappointing for a gym with satellite tv.\\n\\n- PF has lowered rates for new customers and done nothing for their existing ones. They've even given equipment away to one of their other gyms meaning you're getting less for your money. \\n\\n- Trainers hold special aerobics classes inside the gym. No, not inside the aerobics room, inside the gym where people work out. It's not unusual to see people doing wind sprints up and down the hallway or a group of people doing ab work in front of a machine you'd like to use. \\n\\n-For years this place didn't provide paper towels. If you wanted to clean down equipment or your brow, you had to buy a towel or bring your own. The bathroom only had heated dryers or toilet paper. \\nIt now has paper towel dispensers but some are often empty and workers rarely care. Patrons here do a great job cleaning up after themselves. \\n\\n- Pushing supplements is more important than pushing you to work harder. This location has a very hard time keeping female trainers. Women are constantly being hired, but they don't last long. I'm told being  a trainer there is very difficult because you are not just required to recruit a stable of people to train, you have to sell them supplements as well. PF sells its own brand of supps  and trainers will tell you how wonderful they are, better prices than stores, etc. I think the trainers are competent, I'm told they're required to sell stuff though and convincing one that Apex is better than name brands and much cheaper is not what we want to hear during our training. \\n\\n- Loose or damaged equipment is often left unattended. From week to week some of the same dumb bells are loose and I once reported a bent bar on the bench press and no one there cared to remove it. I told multiple employees too.\\n\\n- Aerobics classes are subpar and so are the times. Some of the classes are titled one thing and then when you get into the class they're doing something else. I once did a kickboxing class and the girl had us doing wind sprints and some kind of standing aerobic movements that didn't involve punching or kicking. Many of their better classes start at like 5 p.m. It's almost as if their schedule is geared around students. \\n\\nThere's a high turnover rate at this gym too. From the front desk girls to the trainers (many of the male trainers have been there a while) to the managers. There's literally a different manager there every few weeks and the guy who introduces himself to you on a Wednesday and says 'If you have any problems my name's Bob,\\\"\" will be named Steve a few weeks later and Mark after that.\\n\\nCompetitive pricing compared to other gyms, convenience and decent, clean equipment keep me going there.\\n\\nUnless this gym is really convenient for you or the price is well below what other gyms are charging, check into your other options.",

For a subtly flavored red curry, it had a nice balance and a unique creamy flavor.  It was a very watery curry, but had well balanced flavor so it worked out.  The green and red peppers were pretty juicy (P.A. has raised the bar here), and the beef was tender.  There was lots of bamboo, but not to the annoying amounts that Archi's does.

As far as the visit itself, it was average.  The only treatment they did was to drain the blood with a needle.  No big deal, figured ok, issue resolved, keep pressure on it and it will eventually heal.  WRONG!  After doing some research online and calling other vets, what they did was basically pointless, the ear is filling back up with blood and the issue will have to be fixed with surgery in order to resolve it permanently.  Guess what this POINTLESS treatment cost...$400!!!!  The exam itself was $75 and a flippin' bandage was $53!!  We are FURIOUS!!  Not only did they do nothing to solve the issue, they completely took advantage of us in our worry for our dog.  We have called for quotes for the actual surgery that will resolve the hemotoma to several other vets in the area and the surgery will actually be less expensive than what these ridiculous people charged us for doing jack-sh!t.  Oh!  And when we called them to tell them the hematoma came back they wanted to charge us $40 for the follow-up.  If you have any concern for finances, DO NOT GO HERE!",

Don't get me wrong - I love the food at Woodlands, but it doesn't exactly transport you. I totally get that there are parts of the world, in Charlotte, India and elsewhere, that are total dives, and I have no problem with that. But for those who have a desire to go somewhere else when you dine, this has to be at or near the top of your list. Copper is right up there too, but where they are elegant, Blue Taj is more magical - like you expect Aladdin to come out and take you on a magic carpet ride (and not the LSD sort). Pretty neat trick being that you're in a strip mall near Ballantyne.\\n\\nService is generally friendly - though it pales a bit in comparison to the atmosphere. I mean really, what wouldn't? They do keep the glasses filled, though it service tapers off. I don't know if this is an Asian thing, as several other Indian-type places (Situl, Woodlands come to mind) in Charlotte just forget about you later in the meal. Maybe it's cultural.\\n\\nAs to the food: Very solid offerings. It's not the best I've had in town, but far from the worst. Like much of the Chinese that you'll find around, it does have a tendency to be a bit heavy on the sauce - though instead of the sweetness of the Chinese variety, it's just a thick sauce that can be on the spicy side if you order it that way.\\n\\nPerfectly serviceable option, and well worth it for the experience.",

First, our party of three arrived for our 8:00pm reservation a few minutes early, and had to wait until about 8:30pm before we were seated -- strike 1.  We ventured to the bar to wait, where I decied I'd try one of their speciality cocktails they were offering for the night - except not, because they were out -- strike 2.  When we were finally seated, we were crammed into a crowded, loud, dark corner where we could barely move -- strike 3. \\n\\nTo expand, the atmosphere and ambiance of Olives is awful.  They have crammed way too many tables into their already cramped dining room, for no other reason than because they can, I would suppose.  The wait staff is constantly bumping into the backs of chairs and are forced to reach in front of you to accomplish even the simplest tasks.  A side effect of the crowded dining room is the noise.  Even at a small table, you can forget about conversation unless you feel like losing your voice from shouting by the end of your meal (I'm exaggerating, but this place is WAY too loud for a high-end restaurant).  The lighting is ineffective, and the tables are so dark that you can barely see what you're eating - this is not necessarily a bad thing, because the food was so overly complex, that it failed on just about every level.  Yet another restaurent that fails because of what I like to call 'Top Chef Syndrome' - leave the campy molecular gastronomy, overly complex sauces, and useless garnishes to the few professionals that do it well, and get back to the basics of just cooking your food well.\\n\\nEverything (with the exception of the osso buco, which was the only highlight of the meal) was just not up to par with a restaurant of this reputation and price.

This visit would've been a 5 ratings or even a 4 but around 2am, the bouncer kicked us out of our table because we didn't have any alcohol beverages anymore on the table, I didn't know or wasn't notified that you have to have drinks at the table at all times in order to stay there. Bummer.... Regardless of getting kicked out, things was going fine, until two of my friends lost their wallet because someone pickpocketed him. this had happen almost consistently; once this trip and another back in August.  My friend who lost her phone did not drop it because it was in her purse that was zipped up. I don't really blame Hakkasan for the thefts, since it could happen at any nightclub, but people should just be extra careful when they go to Hakkasan. Go hard for another nightclub! :)",

        "ori": "Saturday afternoon, coming to the end of the lunchtime rush. I was pointed to a window seat as I was on my own and given a menu. Then I waited. And waited. And waited. \\n\\nI dallied with the idea that if I turned round to face the sushi chef, that I would have more of a chance of my order being taken, but given that that would be rather rude, I turned back again to face the window, but in a perky and expectant way. Don't ask me to repeat this, as it was hard enough the first time. \\n\\nFinally my order was taken. I went for the set lunch menu of nigiri, maki and miso with a green tea. I was craving miso on such a wintery day and figured that the rest of the meal would work, even if it did involve cucumber rolls, which to me is always a copout in sushi (it's a personal thing - it just doesn't have any flavour to me). I did throw in some spicy tuna rolls as well as I was hungry and figured on skipping the cucumber rolls. \\n\\nFor the first time in any Japanese restaurant, I was given one cup of tea, no pot. Given that I never saw the waitress again til I got the bill, I ended up being rather thirsty (note this is a tiny restaurant).\\n\\nFirst up was the spicy tuna rolls. It smelled rather strongly but tasted ok. Spicy, but not a huge amount of flavour. I did like the texture of the rice though. Next up was the chef's selection of nigiri which involved two pieces of squid - I'll put my hands up right now and say I didn't eat it. Tried it once, nearly choked, never again. I'm a safe sushi eater (tuna, salmon, eel and fish roe), and I am ok with that. Saying that, I thought it was a nice touch to include all varieties of fish in the selection so that the more adventurous get something with more bite. There was also some less than fresh looking tuna (I get it, it isn't native to here so going to be defrosted, but it looked really sad to me), salmon and egg. The cucumber rolls were overpoweringly doused in wasabi. The salmon rolls were ok, but not a lot of flavour. \\n\\nYou might wonder where my miso description went to, but it goes in last as that is when it turned up - after I reminded the waitress. Definitely, US miso is more salty as I experienced the same watery miso I had in other restaurants in town. I'll take that as noted. \\n\\nFinally, when I did get the bill, the waitress wasted no time in trying to take it away from me - even while I was still trying to get the cash out. Tip? Hell no. Would I be back, most likely not - there are better sushi joints in town. Prices are cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for and with raw fish, I would rather pay higher and make sure the fish doesn't try to return to the sea anytime soon.",

On top of the lack of security, I'm not sure any of the teachers have any formal education or teaching credentials. Miss Melanie the supervisor/manager is extremely brusk and rude. If she was working the front desk she would NEVER greet my daughter or me at drop offs or pickups. She would make eye contact and look back down at her phone or paperwork. The center is outdated and I witnessed large groups of children eating snacks and lunches on the floor in the hallway. There were older children (8-10 year old's) running around the younger pre-k children completely unsupervised. My daughter learned some EXTREMELY inappropriate things and constantly complained about older kids picking  on her and calling her names. My daughter is well adjusted and has never had issues.

        "ori": "This review is only for the club.\\nThis new club has quite the line up of DJ's, and the weekend we were there Tiesto was spinning on Sat night! Being that he is among the top DJ's on the planet, we figured it would be packed so, of course, I turn to my fellow Yelpsters for advice...\\nLet me confirm and clear up a few things now that I have been there. \\nFirst the nerve-wrecking stairs, this is a 5 story spot, but the club is only 3 stories. You enter on the main floor, so if you are there for EDM, stay there and no stairs. The main floor is the middle, so if you are there for hip-hop go downstairs, and now I can see a problem.\\nSecond the non-VIP seating policy, there actually are places to sit for non-VIP. If you go downstairs, damn stairs!, you have two directions at the bottom, straight in the main room or do a 180 and walk down the hall. The back room is open seating, at least until the promoters sell the seat as VIP, but to us it seamed like we had a place to sit all night. Plus those bartenders are way less busy and hoooook it up!\\nThird the nice staff, this one is true! These were without a doubt the nicest bouncers and bartenders we had ever dealt with, and we have been to clubs from SF to Ibiza. It was a much better feel than the normal steroid-staredown that you get from most clubs in Vegas. \\nFourth the dress code, this is normal for Vegas, smart casual. A previous post mentions flip-flops, I did not see any, but let's face it a dress code is 99.9% for the guys so maybe she did sneak in with them on...\\nFifth the music in the hip hop room, the posts about the gangster rap are probably from people that did not stay down there long enough, we really felt there was a good mix of many genres of hip hop, but we were there for Tiesto!\\nLast the dance floor, prior posts are accurate, there is little to no dance floor for a club that holds 5000 people. The main dance floors get so packed that it becomes more of a collective fist pump rather than dancing. We found that upstairs was the better place to dance. There is an open area up there, and while not technically a dance floor, we sure turned it into one! Oh and you can see the DJ booth from up there, if you look through the VIP's lining the rail. \\nThe lack of dance floor space is the reason I knocked a star off. All in all this is a great club, and with DJ's like Tiesto how can you go wrong.",

The rooms are like any other nice hotel on the strip. The best part was getting a room with a view of the fountains. \\nOther yelpers recommending getting to the pool early for preferred seating. I'd usually cabana it- but I don't think me and this baby bump could really be out there, so the best for us was to get in before 9am and find a spot with either an umbrella or shade trees. The small pools with the fountain have COLD water. The larger pools are warmer.

He was pleasant enough and although the place was practically empty he was never around when I wanted him and always around asking if I needed anything while I was stuffing my face full of sea creatures. The steampot was fine but the whole box of spices they add to it completely ruin the dish and I shudder to think they try to do that to hide how not-so-fresh the seafood is..ugh..Well I didn't have my face in a toilet or have exploding diarrhoea after or die from sea creature poisoning so there's a plus.

And you know what, each and every one of those weirdo meats are effing delicious. Cooked to perfection. Fall apart tender. Melt in your mouth delicious. So freaking good.\\n\\nIf they can make beef intestines taste delicious, you bet your ass their traditional meat options like carnitas and pollo are equally as delectable. \\n\\nThey make their own tortillas and both the flour and corn are tender and flavorful. You'll end up looking forward to that first and last tortilla-filled bite of a burrito, and you'll wish they doubled up their corn tortillas on the tacos. (And don't worry, you don't need a double banger tortilla on the taco. I've only had a corn tortilla disintegrate on me when I've left it to sit and sop up juices for ages.)\\n\\nMake sure to take advantage of the salsa bar.

The red and green sauce will suffice in a pinch, but that bright green avocado sauce blows 'em away. The marinated carrots, cucumber slices and radishes are also spot on.

Alot of food I found myself pouring soy sauce on because it lacked a bit of a punch and flavor. If they can pull that off, then things would be alot better because my veggie quesadilla was solid, but using soy sauce on that product was not the best choice. The plain fried rice was exactly what I wanted and although they only have a handful of chicken breast choices, the one I picked was good. It was with the green sauce and ginger combo and I ordered that in the combination with that quesadilla for about eight bucks.

The pay-what-you-can classes are a bit cooler, around 80-85 degrees.\\n\\nThe Price: Not the cheapest yoga studio. But the price includes a hand towel, filtered water, a block, and that high-quality mat cleaner spray. Not to mention a 95-degree room. This stuff isn't cheap. There are student, teacher, and military discounts; as well as 30 and 90-day all-you-can eat packages.\\n\\ntl;dr it's great. Go.",

        "ori": "My baby daughter goes here and I am very pleased with the level of interaction and care she receives.  \\n\\nWhen I was looking for a daycare for her I toured several, and even considered the same daycare that my 5 year old son had attended for the last 4 years right down the road (but had left a few months prior due to his recent attitude problems at that daycare).  I needed to know that my tiny, fragile, premature daughter would be in good hands.  I graded the daycare centers that I toured on the compassion I felt and level of competency I sensed from the daycare director, the interaction from the teachers and amenities I noted in the baby room, the cleanliness of the facility and the general sense I had of the place.  The weekly price wasn't my main concern, although it CERTAINLY wasn't a non-issue.  \\n\\nOne daycare I looked at seemed nice (they even had a sign in the lobby stating that they watched children free of charge for interviewing parents, which I thought was sweet) but I didn't like the way the place smelled and the baby room seemed too small.  Another place didn't have an appropriate outdoor play place for the tots, and that wasn't okay with me, even though in every other sense they were a contender.\\n\\nBut when I toured Maxwell I was very impressed with the whole center.  The center was spacious, bright, colorful and had lots and lots of children's artwork decorating the walls.  Although my child is far too small for it, there is a RAD, two-story indoor play town with a slide and other neat things for the older kids for when it is too hot for them to safely play on the outside playground.  The director, Kristin, was knowledgeable and attentive to my questions.  The baby room teachers seemed sincere and down to earth, and the baby room itself was clean, bright and colorful.  I read though the parent handbook and the enrollment paperwork they offered, and somewhere in the explanation of what services they guaranteed to provide to your child on a daily basis was a promise that they would hug your child each day.  I thought that was neat.  (I mean, it's assumed that a daycare will be affectionate and caring towards your small child when you take them there, but how many of them actually promise you that your child will get a hug each day??)  Anyway, the rates and registration fees were competitive and everything else checked out with me so I enrolled my baby there.\\n\\nNow, we've been going there almost a year, and to be honest there have been one or two times where I was annoyed at other parents for doing some (thoroughly) annoying things, like clogging up the circular driveway in front as they leisurely dropped off their child and chatted with other people in the hallway (as opposed to parking over in the parking lot if they wanted to take their sweet time in the daycare center and saving the driveway for the parents in a hurry), or even worse people parking behind me in the driveway when I already had someone parked in front of me and basically trapping my car as I waited for either one of them to move so I could get out (GRR!!).  But overall I am very, very happy.  My baby girl LOVES her morning and afternoon teachers, and has no separation issues at all when I drop her off because she is always so excited to see them and start playing.  \\n\\nAnd I can tell that they genuinely love her over there.  In fact, she had a small surgery that required a two night hospital stay not long after we started going to MPA and her teacher called to check on her condition after her surgery.  Then she got really sick earlier this year with RSV and spent two different stints at Phoenix Children's Hospital, of more than a week each stay, not only did MPA NOT charge me for the time she was away (believe it or not, some places actually would) but they also made her a get well card that had at least a dozen teachers signatures and messages for her written on there, and her morning teacher also came clear over to PCH to see her and give her hugs!  She was so happy to see her.  :)  That meant a lot to me.  \\n\\nAlso, twice now my vacation time has fallen about 4 weeks before my bi-annual vacation credit was due and they still let me take the week off without a charge.  It was SO appreciated during these very tight times!\\n\\nAnyway, this is a GREAT daycare center!  Love them! :)",

I havn't had any awful service, but it is definitely way below where it should be for the caliber of food.   Average at best.\\n\\nI hadn't been in a while, and went the other night.  I found the menu had been redone to add a lot more affordable items, and it seems to have picked up business a bit and service also better.   As business gets better hopefully they can attract better servers and stay consistent.   \\n\\nBut the food was great.",

This particular PPP location is relatively small but it was roaring busy by just a little after 11 AM, opening time.\\n\\nFirst off was a serving of each of the three tossed salads.  These weren't the same as what I have enjoyed at a couple of other Peter Pipers lately & unfortunately they weren't labeled. I was going to subtract a Star but they all tasted good & then these guys did great in the pizza department.     :-)\\n\\nPeter Piper's pizzas are much improved over a while back, & over at the hot table they were flying in from the ovens ovens loaded up high with all manner of tasty toppings.  I started with one that had Canadian Bacon & Jalepe\\u00f1os, then it was on to others with such toppings as bacon, mushrooms, Italian Sausage, Pepperoni & so on.  All were excellent.  My preference is for thin crust, but the ones I had all seemed to be medium.  You may order up pizzas & their crust any way you like, but I didn't want to wait for special cooking.

I planned on having a party of 13 eat and drink there for my sister's bridal dinner and went back and forth with the manager regarding seating.  She claimed if we wanted to sit on the patio we had to have a set menu, which would run us about $60 per person.  Honestly, I don't have that type of money and if I did I wouldn't have spent it there.  Also, where is the patio located in this place?  The pictures online are very misleading.  We talked to the manager and wanted a large table in the back and we were told that would be fine.  We were put in the very front of the entrance in the middle of the room ( which was in between two bars).  The thing that irritates me the most is we could have just shown up and probably got a better seat with having to go through all the hassle of reserving a table.  \\n\\nThe service was ok.  There was one lady who was actually paying attention to our table and she wasn't even our waitress (I wish I could remember her name).  On several occasions we asked for waters and the waitress said ok and never came back.  In all honesty she knew because the party was over 10 people she had a guaranteed tip included.  She was NOT worth the $91.00 tip.   \\n\\nThe food was ok.  I wasn't wowed by anything.  The waitress said everything would come out when it's ready and at different times.

There are so many things I love about Bandera I need to make a list, paragraph form just won't cut it.\\n1. Consistency. In my experience very few restaurants can pull off making the same dish exactly the same way every single time. Bandera does. We go back over and over again for our favorites and it always tastes exactly the way it's supposed to.\\n2. Food. It's amazing. Some of our favorites:\\n     -grilled artichokes\\n     - corn bread (my arteries hate me afterwards but seriously, best corn bread ever)\\n     -macho salad\\n     - crispy chicken sandwich\\n     - peanut cole slaw\\n     - every single fresh seasonal vegetable they serve\\n     - banana cream pie\\n3. Service. Always friendly. Always knowledgable. Love that I can start a tab at the bar while I wait for dinner and they transfer it to the dinner table, no questions asked. And yes, the bartender is tipped out appropriately on this transfer so I don't have to worry about that. \\n4. Take out. It's hard to find take out that tastes as good at home as it does in the restaurant. Sometimes you just want to eat something delicious in your pajamas and on your couch! And as many times as we have ordered take out from Bandera (and it's been a lot of times) they have never once messed up our order or forgotten anything. Seriously! That never happens but here, it just does. \\n\\nSo, long story longer, we love Bandera. If you've been hopefully you've had the same amazing experiences we have. If you haven't been, GO!

They've done away with paper covering the tables (no big deal). The waitress told us \\\"\"If you want water, tea or soda, it's serve yourself now.\\\"\" Okay, but I don't really go out to dinner to serve myself, and given the uncovered coughing and sneezing of the patrons, I didn't really want to partake of anything from the communal serving station. The servers used to start by bringing out a little paper bag filled with pieces of several kinds of bread baked in the restaurant, with a tasty little tapenade-ish spread for it. Gone. The pizza used to be on delicious ciabatta crust. Not anymore. Out of the bag flatbread (or so it seemed) now. And the homemade ice cream in interesting flavors (balsamic and sea salt, honey and chile, brandy cinnamon, etc.)? Gone. Replaced by generic gelato flavors (vanilla bean, chocolate and peanut butter). The entrees were fine, but not exceptional, and given the cutbacks to service and amenities, $19 for some fish and rice is a little steep.

OHSO provides free dog treats and water bowls to keep your dog happy. We came to brunch on a Sunday, so of course they had all the football games playing around the bar. OHSO has a great Sunday brunch special which includes a 10 oz beer and a choice of one of their brunch dishes for $10. Even without the special their normal prices are awesome, with pitchers of quality beer for only $9!  We got the breakfast flatbread and a pitcher of Orange Blossom, that's from Papago brewery, and omg they were both delicious. The orange blossom had a unique taste of oranges and a hint of vanilla, it was hard not to chug all of it immediately! The flatbread was amazing, it had eggs, spinach, Spanish chorizo and much more I can't remember. You could taste the great quality of the ingredients they used! I saw a LOT ( i mean a lot) of people get the biscuits and gravy, which you would think is ordinary but they put a classy twist on the dish, I will definitely try it next time, it looks so good!

        "ori": "Dr. Garrett at SCP is in 1 word - AMAZING!!\\n\\nWhen I was on the hunt for a pediatrician for Baby C while I was still pregnant, I asked a few of my fellow colleagues where they take/have taken their kids.  A lot of them mentioned SCP (both the Shea and Osborn locations).  I gave them a call and let them know I was still pregnant, but was looking for a ped for my son when he arrived.  I had questions - they happily answered!  I had a feeling this was going to be a good match.\\n\\nSo fast forward to Baby C's birth.  I knew from the moment I learned I was pregnant that I wanted to breastfeed.  Our first official day at the birthing suites, in the couplet rooms, on the night shift..I had a nurse from HELL.  From manhandling me and Baby C, to belittling my efforts and pushing formula.  At 6am, I snapped.  I literally lost my shit and went a little nuts, crying hysterically and hyperventilating after the Demon Nurse did her final check on us and got her last rude comment in before she left.  Dr. Garrett walked in a minute later.  She calmed me down, told me that my body knew what to do (and I needed to trust that and myself), and then proceeded to go report the nurse to the nursing supervisor.  From that moment - I knew Dr. Garrett had not only Baby C's best interest but mine (and my parenting plan/wishes) as well.  A match made in baby heaven!\\n\\nNow, unfortunately Baby C suffers from a few respiratory ailments.  The handful of times I've taken him in, Dr. Garrett is pleased with how my treatment has gone thus far (giving breathing treatments, etc) and she basically trusts my judgment (i have my own resp issues, so I know the drill).  Baby C has dodged the hospital admission bullet a few times - because we can get a handle on his breathing and she knows that I'm on the ball with his treatment.  But she knows that if I bring him in to be seen, there's a problem.  \\n\\nOH - She's also not one of those Drs that will just throw antibiotics at the problem.  Not if antibiotics aren't truly warranted.  She in fact isn't the kinda Dr to prescribe meds just to appease the patients parents.  I know a few parents like that...demanding antibiotics for a basic virus that antibiotics wont do squat for (but help with the problem of antibiotic resistant super-bugs).   \\n\\nOh and the office staff - from the front desk to the nurses are wonderful too!.  OH and Mary Beth is an excellent NP!!  We've seen her a few times when we couldn't get in to see Dr. Garrett. \\n\\nI can and will shout it from the mountain tops - I love this Peds Office and Dr. Garrett!!  :D",

The restaraunt was clean and inviting. My wife had the Chef's salad which was large and had lots of meats and cheeses. I had the \\\"\"American Grilled Cheese.\\\"\". The tomatoes were fresh and ripe and the bacon was thick and cooked properly. You can also get an ice cold beer if you want. There are also some great specialty sodas available.\\n\\nI would go back for lunch and I reccomend this place for anyone who doesn't want to break the bank for lunch at Kierland.",

Also the people are very polite. \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with any of the items on the menu. If you would like a warm soup for you meal, go for the Udon soup (I believe it's $2.00 for one tempura shrimp to be added with the soup). If you want something with a little bit of everything, the bento box consist of the meat and served with 1 roll of California tempura, salad, and rice. More importantly, the sushi is great and they never run out of fish!",

The food wasn't the best food I've ever tasted, but it was definitely very good for the price. We found out about this buffet on our last day in Vegas.

My husband got the guiness chocolate and we another friend got the cinnamon. We all tried the bacon ice cream which was very unique and not bad at all. I tried the blue cheese ice cream and while it was good, I'm not sure I could do a whole scoop of it!

While it sounds like an odd combo, it was tasty and light filled with a sizeable portion of pasta, fresh crab, tomatoes, spinach and a dose of fresh crab meat. And it was spicy! It a good way, of course. \\n\\nFor dessert a few girlfriends and I sampled the warm chocolate cake with nutella gelato (WINNER), the apple crostada (with cinammon gelato - delightful) and the mint chocolate chip gelato.

The tuna tartare is one of those over served dishes that you see on so many menus these days, but I'd be happy to just scoop up spoonful after spoonful of Michael Mina's version. Extremely fresh, with a nice little kick of heat, mixed at the table. As I write this review during my lunch break, I could use a plate of it right now. The other standout would have to be the lobster pot pie. I mean...just look at the name of that dish, how could it be anything but delicious?\\n\\nSure, the meal will but a dent in your wallet. But you're walking into a top-end restaurant in a top-end Vegas hotel...you already know what you're getting into. That being said, the meal was great from start to finish.

For $12 you get a filling assortment of pumpkin seeds, blue cheese, eggs, avocado, tomatoes, and grilled steak. \\n\\nFor dinner I tried their version of sorullitos. Holy cow. This is the reason I returned twice. These things are the distant, beautiful cousins to the ones you get in Puerto Rico. The cousin everyone wants, but no one can have, because, well, it's family and that'd be wrong. But here, it's okay. Eat the corny fried thing with the secret spicy sauce. \\n\\nGuess the thing that puts Bar + Bistro above the rest is the atmosphere. It's real. Authentic.

I also like the Ronin burger. I mean who doesn't love fried egg and katsu in their burger. Right? Their fries are awesome! I recomment the garlic parmesan fries are awesome. LOADED with flavor. Very garlicy and lost of parmesan in it if you like that. If you want to go for a softer tasting flavor for fries I'd say the sweet potatoes. Those go really well with the Kalbi burger. I also might suggest that you try at least ONE drink that isn't a coke or pepsi product. Their beverages are one of a kind, and tastey. So be brave! Try one of them. The feel of the place is very simple, hip, and urban. Easy enough. It doesn't have all the extra mumbo jumbo or glitz and glamour of the strip. So if you are looking for a casual place to eat with great service. Try it! I swear it is an experience!",

Two jobs that I had felt just about anyone would get it right no matter who I hired.  A third job however was to install a new range hood but instead of venting back into the house like my current hood, I wanted it vented outside.  This had me nervous but I decided to go with Eli based on his Yelp reviews.  \\n\\nI have to say that all three jobs were executed perfectly.  He brought the range vent up through my cabinets and into my attic where he went up through the tile roof.  Certainly not a trivial job but the final result looks like it was installed when the house was built.  The venting was taped off perfectly and the holes he drilled perfectly fit the tubing.  \\n\\nHe showed up on time to the minute and did a great job cleaning up all of the dust and debris from the cutting and drilling.  The shower cartridge was a 15 year old original so thank god I did not attempt to do that myself.
