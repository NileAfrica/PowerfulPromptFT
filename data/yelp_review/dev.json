        "ori": "This place has a lot of potential, but they really need to get their act together.  We did not get what we were expecting. \\n\\nFirst, much of the resort is under construction.  So much in fact, that we thought it was a newer resort.  According to one of the traffic officers we talked to (as we waited to actually be able to get out past the construction) it's not a new property, but the resort is ALWAYS doing work.  We would have loved to know this before booking.  The construction was inconvenient when traveling the grounds, and the pools were closed for work (what's a resort without a pool?).  The majority of the shops on the property were available for lease, so there wasn't really much in the way of shopping or dining on site. \\n\\nOne of the biggest disappointments is that we were not given everything that was promised with the room.  Their website states that a \\\"\"complimentary fishing permit\\\"\" is included with the room. As of 6/9/2013 the website still says this.  Prior to arriving we called the resort to ask if this permit was a Nevada fishing permit, or exclusive to the resort lake.  We were told it was a Nevada license and could be used to fish at any lake in Nevada.  Wrong!  There was no Nevada fishing permit, nor complimentary fishing permit of any kind.  They said what they offered was actually a card where we could pay (Yes, PAY.  That doesn't sound complimentary) based on what we caught and then return the fish to them.  Really?  Who pays for fish they don't even get to keep?  Aside from that, however, even if we had decided to go for this card option, it wasn't even available to us.  We were told fishing was not currently permitted because they were restocking the lake.  Yet another amenity that was unavailable.  Why does their website say guests receive a complimentary permit when this isn't the case, and why were we given incorrect information when we called?  We felt cheated.  When we went to the front desk to talk about it, they weren't willing to do anything to accommodate and just acted like it wasn't their problem they were advertising services they didn't deliver. \\n\\nWhen we booked the resort, we purchased a deal that included free breakfast every day, as well as other extras including free appetizers at the Sonrisa grill.  Guests booking with this deal should be aware that the free breakfast is a choice of either pancakes or eggs, each with smaller portions than the typical menu options.  Also, we were told we were not allowed to use both appetizer vouchers.  I find this ridiculous since we paid for them in the package we bought.  It was just one more thing we were promised and not given.  \\n\\nAs for the room itself, it was ok.  It had a kitchenette, including a small stove, microwave, dishwasher, and pretty much anything you could need to cook.  This was nice and was probably the best part about the room.  As for the rest, the showers were really strange.  It was like the shower nozzle hadn't been centered quite right, so if you wanted to get properly under the water, you have  to move to the side and be attacked by the shower curtain the whole time.  The decor was standard and the bed was comfortable enough.  It wasn't the worst room I've stayed in, but it certainly wasn't the nicest, either.  Be aware that unless you hit it at the right time, you won't get to park in the secure garage.  It's small and tight with not nearly enough spaces for how large the resort is.  Also, if you need reliable internet while you travel, this isn't the place for you.  The connection was horrible.  \\n\\nWhen we checked out, nobody bothered to ask how our stay was.  Probably because they knew it was pretty lousy overall.  Bad job, Aston.  We won't be staying here again and we were sorry to give any of our money to a resort that is so apathetic to its customers and so deceptive in its advertising.  \\n\\nOn a side note, the bartenders at Harry's were great.  We also had free drink vouchers with our package, but we don't drink alcohol.  They didn't give us a hard time about it and were cheerful and accommodating with substitutions.  They were the only decent service we got during our stay.  I feel bad that they are associated with such a rotten place.",

First red flag, our rooms were by the swimming pools that are under construction.  This was not a problem Saturday and Sunday.  Monday morning the back hoes started beeping at 7am!!!  When we complained, we were told it was an error and work would not begin until after 10am.  Tuesday morning 7am beep-beep-beep!!  We asked to be moved.  We were told we could be moved but would not know what rooms until after 2pm  Our luggage was taken to the bell desk to be held until we had new rooms.  We went out for the day and returned to the hotel at 5pm  We did not have new rooms assigned.  Why?  Now we are told we had to be present to assign new rooms.  We had two rooms (sister in law suffered this with us as well)  The clerk made a big deal out of making sure we would get a room with two queen beds and a room with a king size bed, as that is what we had originally paid for.  We also asked that our rooms be as close to our sister in law's as possible.  After 20 minutes of BS at the front desk, we got two new rooms 6 doors away from each other.  Sister in laws room--two queen beds.  Our room--two queen beds!  Called front desk and told them the error.  Rooms were also overlooking the bus parking area, another noisy location.  My husband politely asked that we be moved to a room with a king size bed.  Now we were offered to be upgraded into a one bedroom suite.  We accepted and reminded them that we needed to be close to the sister in law's suite as well.  We were relocated to the 10th floor, room overlooking the Excalibur, no problem there.  Sister in law's room on the other side of the building, same floor, but no where near our room.  We gave up at that point even though there was an empty room across the hallway from us.  \\n\\nHow was the suite?  1.  Nice deep jetted tub--jets did not work.  2.  TV in bedroom did not work.  Had to have maintenance called.  They replaced the remote control.  Still did not work.  Maintenance had to return following morning and reprogram TV.\\n3.  No bath robes, extra blankets, bottled water, snacks.   4.  No WI FI  5.  Toiletries Motel 6 quality \\n\\nRestaurants in the hotel---Forget it !!! DO NOT go to the Public House.  Service was terrible, waitress was picking her nose and acted like we had disturbed her in some way.  We asked for another server.  \\n\\nBoarding pass service--Had the tickets printed day before check out.  Clerk would not release both passes to my husband because I was not there.  Said they would hold them for us to pick them up.  Go to pick them up and different clerk has no clue about the tickets.  Needs to reprint them.  Computer jams, needs to reboot and then opens  drawer and guess what??There are our tickets printed and ready to go!!\\n\\nThe deferred maintenance in the hotel, spa, and restaurants is very evident.  The service is no where near a 5.  If this hotel does not keep up with their competition, I will be surprised if they stay in business.\\n\\nHotel NOT clean---There was a repulsive smell in a trash can area by the elevator on the floor where we had our first of 3 rooms!!!  I called housekeeping to report it.  The next day the smell was still there.  Don't know what happened after we moved to the 10th floor.  My guess, it was never completely cleaned up.  Sounds like Brian C. was there the same nights and he noted that as well.  Disgusting!!!!\\n\\nNo WI FI made working in the rooms very difficult.  Charged a resort fee when their swimming pools were not in service.  No night life of any kind except for gaming.  Buffet is low end and boring.\\n\\nLet's hope that the CEO's and management of this hotel reads these comments here.  Wondering if the survey I was sent from the Luxor will be noted as well.  Based on the lack of interest while at the hotel, I doubt it.\\n\\nNext trip to Vegas I will be booking my stay elsewhere and advise everyone else to do the same.",

(Insert drumroll here! )\\n\\nSo I tried it out again with my mother today and I have to say the food was not bad. It was a typical Chinese restaurant but definitely a couple steps higher than the Chinese buffet. I had the chicken chow mein which was rather salty but pretty good. My mother had the moo goo gai pan which was decent. \\nThe service definitely was bad to say the least. I understand that we're right at the edge of Chinatown, however there was an entire staff that had a giant language barrier with me and my mother. After being in business all these years in America, you would think that the English would be getting a little bit better and better. Not so much. We sat down to eat ordered our food and then they brought it out in a to go box. Maybe they were trying to gives a hint to leave? Maybe because I had my 18-month-old son with me and they were dreading having to clean up after him? Honestly whatever the reason was they didn't get that we were there to dying in considering they set us we placed our order. They then brought our food which was lukewarm out to us to our plates to service and never refilled our water. When we get ready to pay we waited in line go to the cashier and realize that they just recently got a B rating from the health District. I wasn't that much of a happy camper.\\n\\nThere are many other amazing Chinese restaurants as well as Chinese fusion restaurants and Thai restaurants in town but I feel more comfortable eating at. I tried this place because it's a little relieved .1 miles from my house. But I don't think I'll be going here again.",

Yes but try telling that to the hostess who greets you by chewing gum and texting on her phone.   Yeah, I get it, sometimes you just got to get your tweet on, I agree, OMG LOL, I can't believe this guy who just came in here to get his to go order, #LMFAO.   Now don't be discouraged to dine in and sit in the bar area, where if you truly want to feel disconnected from your date, then the touch screen monitors are perfect, for you or the hostess.  After all who sits and talks with each other at dinner any more? The food is on par with an Americana type mid level restaurant, however the service leaves a bit to be desired.  When my salad came with a dried up crusted chicken breast on it and no dressing, I called to speak to a manager, but they were busy. Apparently a Tuesday night is busy for the manager (not the hostess).  The veggie burger tastes like cardboard, although the bun gives it a sort of layered cardboard effect which is not bad, if you're washing it down with tequila.  The filet even if ordered med. rare, comes out med. edible, and asking the wait staff for a refill is like asking the DMV for an estimated wait time; you're probably not going to get what you're looking for.   This is particularly sad because I used to love this restaurant, but even with prepubescent couples or online match dates who sit in the bar area to have the touch screen monitors mediate their awkward conversations,  it's still probably not the right fit.   The ribs are good, but the sides aren't.  If I was going to take anybody here, it would have to be my next door neighbor who lets their dog crap all over my lawn and never picks it up, or my grandfather who doesn't have any taste buds left and isn't bothered by slow service, because it takes him two hours to finish a bowl of soup anyway.

I guess I'm not surprised.\\n\\nI would have never even thought to step one foot in the place if I didn't see this establishment featured on the Food Network television show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  You may have seen the show, it's hosted by Guy Fieri, who looks exactly like an over-bleached obese porcupine and who's on-screen talent seems to be limited to the ability to simultaneously stuff enormous bites of bad food into his mouth and mutter \\\"\"awesome\\\"\" or \\\"\"totally-off-the-hook\\\"\" or \\\"\"too-legit\\\"\" or some other outdated, cliched, catch phrase.  \\n\\nIf the show has a quota of each of the three classes of restaurants in the title, then Crystal definitely adds a +1 to the Dives category.  It's a dump.  The \\\"\"restaurant\\\"\" is nothing more than a tiny (~15ft wide) rectangular space most of which is occupied by a dive bar.  There are a few tables in the back of the space, which is windowless save for two small windows at the entrance.  For ambiance, the back of the bar has a couple of televisions (which were blaring college football when I was there), a pile of old electronics junk stuffed into a corner niche, and a few videogames.  The interior is painted flat black - or possibly just coated in decades of cigarette smoke and other grime, which seems likely given the stale cigarettes and beer smell the permeates the place.  For an added special touch during my visit (which occurred around Halloween), one of the videogames had a pumpkin sitting atop it, with a carving in the pumpkin that depicted the silhouette of a man mounting a woman from the rear.  The fact that several of the tables had children didn't seem to deter the restaurant from displaying this extra special decorative treat.  I almost forgot - one wall is also covered with portraits of the owner's family throughout the 1950s and 60s.  It's a very strange sight indeed.\\n\\nSo the TV episode showed that the owner, Crystal, is of Middle-Eastern descent (Lebanese, I think), and her specialty is, of course, Middle-Eastern food.  So we started with the hummus.  It was your basic, chickpeas-out-of-a-can hummus with lemon and tahini.  It was served on a plate with very thin, right-out-of-the-bag, cold slices of pita.  They didn't even take the time to toast the pita.  What was even more puzzling is that the pita was cut - not in wedges, or in some other uniform shape - but seemingly in random sizes and shapes.  WTF?!?  It looked like a 5 year old was allowed to cut the pita.  Some pieces were huge, some tiny to the point of being impractical to use to scoop a bite of hummus.  Strange.\\n\\nMy entree was a lamb kabob which was served along with grilled peppers and onions.  The lamb was good, properly grilled, and succulent.  The grilled peppers and onions weren't seasoned at all - not even a hint of salt.  The dish was served with those randomly-shaped cut pieces of cold pita.  Most of the pieces weren't even large enough to wrap around a single cube of lamb.\\n\\nAll in all, the ambiance stunk, the food was mediocre, and I was afraid to try a draft beer due to the generally unclean appearance of the place (I ordered a bottle).  I cannot imagine why anyone would prefer this place over other Middle-Eastern restaurants in Pittsburgh (Aladdins, for example).\\n\\nI will not be back.",

That being said, I would be sick to my stomach had I paid full price ($250) for our room. \\n\\nWe really enjoyed the two pools. They were very clean, well maintained, and nicely decorated. There were some issues though too. We found it strange that the pool girls would come by when you are not in your chair and actually take the towel away. Why? I just went into the pool! I'm gonna need that towel! Speaking of the pool towels, they were so tiny! More like small shower towels. They need to improve them. Also, the beer selection at the pool bar was kind of weak.\\n\\nThe rooms seemed cool upon entering the hotel, but upon closer inspection you can see how they cut some corners and did a shoddy job on some things. For example, the paint jobs were poor, the bathroom needs a makeover, and the bed frame was terrible! The bed itself was very comfortable, but every time you got out of bed it was so loud, waking up the person next to you. The most annoying part of the room was that the bathroom door wouldn't close all of the way, limiting your privacy. Also, what's with the blue window on the bathroom door too? This hotel seems to want it to be as unpleasant as possible when using the toilet.\\n\\nLastly, the service was pretty bad. I will say the valet guys were very courteous and prompt. I liked them. No problems there. The front desk is where I took issue. Over the two days spent at The Saguaro we had three issues with them and every time they were unapologetic.

Mostly because when any number of my in-laws pick a place to go, it's either this place or Serranos (see my other review)... friendly game of Russian Roulette, anyone?\\n\\nThe other main reason I hate this place is the fact that I have to shower when I get home.  The whole family congregates in the laundry room and we all strip.  We leave everything piled in the stench of burnt food and smoking wood and we take showers to get rid of it.  There is nothing worse than your pillow the morning after San Tan Flat if you failed to take a shower when you got home.\\n\\nI don't understand the whole stand in line to order thing.  Is it a sit-down restaurant?  Yes.  If you eat inside and can actually get a table.  Is it a \\\"\"fast-casual\\\"\" like Pei Wei?  Kinda.  You stand in line, but no one brings you your food.  So really it's fast food?  You place your order and go get it when your number is called?  Yeah.  But it's a steak and it is ANYTHING but fast.  \\n\\nSpeed alone (or lack thereof) is reason enough to stay away.  I don't wait for food.  I don't care how good it is, a wait this long is unacceptable.  Oh, but it's not even good, I forgot to mention.  Actually, my husband and my food came out quickly (20 minutes - and we ordered steaks) - everyone else in the extended family ordered burgers - OVER AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTE WAIT -- FOR A BURGER!!!  Did I mention the food's not that good?  And half the menu is very over-priced.  They should stick to the cheap stuff: it is all anyone orders anyway as evidenced by the run on burgers that caused oppressive delays.\\n\\nThen there is the salad bar -  I'm surprised it passes health code.  See those tongs that are laying ON TOP of the lettuce?  You do realize that everyone else in the place has had their greasy little paws on that handle that is in direct contact with the pile of lettuce?  icky poo.\\n\\nAnd then there are the fire pits.  Has OSHA been here?  Good God, this is such an accident waiting to happen.  It is SO friggin' dark out there, there are all these raging fire pits, kids running everywhere, all these odd obstructions that are 'ambiance' - barrels, wheelbarrows, just waiting to be tripped over.  Did I mention a young woman was taken from this place (some say kidnapped is a better word) and killed?  That's not on the advertisements, is it?\\n\\nAnother ugh from me.

The place where families from all walks of life come together and join hands to eat tons of fried goodness, play impossibly to win games, and enjoy rides that only a carnie could love.\\n\\nThis year was no different.. well actually, there was some things.  I met up with my girlfriends sister who was taking her kids along with my girlfriends kids to the fair this year.  I thought it might be cool to join them since I was leaving work early.\\n\\nFirst thing I notice is the lame \\\"\"CASH ONLY\\\"\" parking for $10... It's 2010.. you'd think the booths might take debit cards by now, right?  Wrong.  I had to flip around, go to Circle K and get cash out.  I finally get there and ahhhh there it is.. the smell of filth, food and family fun.  \\n\\nSince I have some time to kill before the kids show up, I decide to walk down the restaurant row, if you will, to see what fried goodies they have to offer.  \\\"\"Fried Butter\\\"\" read one sign... I tell ya, it was so tempting to just see what the hype was, but I know Id hear about it if I did partake.  So I kept on.  I hadn't eaten lunch yet, so I was pretty hungry.  I saw the sign \\\"\"Giant Corn Dog\\\"\"  enough said..  I had one.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things to do at the fair is people watch; and with the huge mix of types, you could literally spend all day there.  AFter wolfing down my corn dog, I sat by the first stage to listen to some elementary school kids play band and sing.  I could tell that most of them wanted didn't want to be there.. it tends to show through their playing.   \\n\\nMy family shows up and we hit the strip and rides..  \\n\\nMy girlfriend told me \\\"\"Go to the fair with kids and you'll have a totally different experience.\\\"\"  I've always been one of those people who have bashed the fair for being so ghetto (which it 100% is) and dirty (which it is...) and would just have a hay day ripping on various things.  But ya know what? She was right.   The joy you get on kids faces when they get off that ride, eating ice cream, running around.. is just priceless.  It made my fair experience this year, all that better.  That's where I gave it three stars.  They alone, made the fair great for me this year.  \\n\\n\\nOne more thing on the food.. I realllly wanted a giant turkey leg, but paying $9.25 for one, I just couldn't see that.  \\n\\n\\nTips:\\n\\n* Bring money... everything is cash.  Occasionally a food vendor will take visa/mc though.\\n* Walking shoes.. if you dont have them, good luck to your feet.\\n* If you are meeting people, make sure you are parking together.  I parked on the opposite side of the people I was with.\\n* Be prepared to spend a couple hundred dollars.\\n* Check for ways to get in free.. I heard if you brought chapstick in, you got a discount.

To make matters worse, the biscuit was burned on the bottom (very obvious because it was black) but slightly raw and doughy in the middle. And the chipotle flavor didn't work for me.

However, this time, not even the manager cared to make sure that we were okay and it was not even busy during this weeknight.

But because of Chef Fuji's master sushi chef title (if true), I decided to try Marssa. \\nI should have stayed with my instincts and stayed away.\\n\\n1st - Their sashimi plate is mediocre at best. For $70, I would have expected fancier fish, than the boring usual maguro, shake, tai, shiro maguro, etc... No fish was cured so it was very chewy - especially the tai and the shake. No uni, no bass, no spanish mackerel, not even regular mackerel. I was told that there was no toro, which i understand. Toro is seasonal and it is not the season this time. \\n\\n2nd - For $70 sashimi plate and Chef Fuji's master sushi chef title, I should have been served fresh ground wasabi. When asked for it, I was basically treated like \\\"\"it is fresh ground wasabi\\\"\" pointing at the powder based wasabi. I had to re-itterate and tell the waiter to tell the sushi chef for fresh wasabi. He did comply and came back with fresh ground wasabi. Wasabi makes all the difference.\\n\\n3rd - Kids plate is a joke. If you have 7 or 8 year olds, better get 2 kids plates for each kid to fill them up, which is equivalent to an adult plate price.\\n\\n4th - Sushi is Ok. However, for someone with Chef Fuji's master sushi chef title, when I ordered the amaebi, they should have also brought out the deep fried shrimp head. \\n\\nConclusion - If you are into rolls, this place is OK, although very very pricey. I am not a fan of chain sushi restaurants like Nobu or Sushi Roku because of the impersonal fish selection. However those places are much much better than Marssa.

At first, when they came out they interacted a lot at the beginning, and it seemed like it was going to be a great show. However, if you buy the more expensive tickets on the main floor, get those next on the aisles or you will be disappointed. \\n\\nTim was the only one who carried the weight of the entire show. Faith seemed to be struggling with everything, her voice and singing sounded awful. I thought it might be a mic issue but Tim sounded great, so that couldn't be it.  Faith never took time to connect with her audience. She had no charisma.  Tim had more energy. Faith was lackluster, appeared aloof and out of touch. Her individual songs that she sang lacked any kind of connection, like she was just going through the motions.  She stood only or sat and really didn't move around on stage much.  Faith was utterly boring. Then it got worse. Faith had all kinds of wardrobe issues and towards the end, her discomfort got worse when she wore her awful super long pair of pants -- that just did it for me.  I was not enjoying this show.  Faith laughed off her pants, but that didn't help me.  I couldn't stop worrying that she was going to trip and fall on stage because she was so immobile.  All I could concentrate on were her super long pants and how she didn't move much at all, but stood there a statue singing pretty badly. By the end of the show you really have to wonder, how did this woman get so popular and why was I even a fan! I know of so many better performers and singers, amateurs, who are way better singers and performers than Faith. \\n\\nIt was a huge relief when Tim sang. I went to the show, not a Tim fan, but by the end of the night, I switched to a Tim fan. Without him, the show would've been terrible for me--hardly what I would've expected would've happened to me on a so-called Soul-to Soul-to concert!  \\n\\nSoul to Soul... the title was misleading.   I expected a lot more personal stories and singing between the two of them. It was not personable. I learned nothing about them really. If Tim didn't talk about himself a bit and sign his guitar to give to a kid in the audience, there would've been nothing. \\n\\nI would never go see a show with Faith in it again. I might go see Tim alone in his own concert maybe. However, for this show, it won't be what you expected and certainly not worth what you paid.  Save your money for other shows.

Loved this cake's texture, which was a little denser than that of Tracy's, and the combo of the its texture and fondant/ganache was new to me.  I've had cakes w/ a fondant topping, and I've had cakes frosted w/ ganache, but not one w/ both!  Out of all the cakes I sampled, CC's simple vanilla cupcake and PPMC's ganache-topped yellow cake topped my list UNTIL someone brought out the...\\n\\nVegan chocolate cake- Eggless chocolate cake w/ raspberry jam doubling as a filling and as a topper, w/ garnishes of strawberries.  The bottom had a tan-colored layer, which I assumed would taste like mocha, but I didn't detect any coffee notes.  At first glance, I thought it might have been flourless, but closer inspection revealed a cake-y texture.  This cake was served slightly warm and tasted very good.  DPPM deserved my vote for \\\"\"best birthday cake\\\"\" by offering both vegan and non-vegan cakes, IMO!\\n\\nBREAD BASKET: White cake, cherry and vanilla filling, and frosting.\\nLiked the flavor combo and the cake's texture, but I was felt like the flavors could've been a little more potent. (Summers Fruit Barn in Phoenix sells breads and pastries from Bread Basket.)\\n\\nI also sampled Sweet Republic's Pumpkin spice ice cream, a seasonal item.  It was fabulous!

Because of this new Peter's Yard takeaway, they've decided that, during lunchtime, you're not allowed to get takeaway coffee from the older Peter's Yard.

But, I was getting a takeaway coffee, a chocolate ball and a slice of pizza (I was hungover and was trying to cure myself on my way to work)... The takeaway part didn't have the latter two. So, they decided to make me go out to the other Peter's Yard, get a coffee there, to then come back and get everything else there. Instead of just making me a coffee on the spot.

I have tried to contact the hotel, and I just get forwarded to the reservations line, which in turn directs me to Ceasar Groups 'Citywide Group Sales'.\\n\\nI must say, this is where things took a turn for the worst. I have been dealing with representative Wendy Demay, for nearly 48 hrs now. \\n\\nTo make an incredibly long story short, Wendy was only interested in selling me a 'Group' package, where we were required to sign a contract, pay 50% up front, have limited access to the menu, limited access to the bar selections, and where we would be unable to order anything else from the menu whatsoever! Even if we agreed to the contract !!!\\n\\n I explained to Wendy several times, that we were not interested in ordering from a 'fixed' menu. Instead of offering up options, or compromises, or even offering to contact the restaurant herself to see if there was anything she could do to help, she refused to, claiming that this is the only option, the way that it is, take it or leave it.\\n\\nShe claims that Steak cannot accommodate a party of this size and deliver the standard of service it prides itself on.\\n\\nIt is my contention that if the restaurant can handle two separate parties of 7 or 8 on the same night, at the same time with access to the full bar and dinner menus, then why on earth can it not handle one party of 12-14 ??\\n\\nFurthermore, this dinner is going to run us about $5000, if I'm gonna spend that kinda coin on a meal... I want to drink the wine I want to drink... order the appetizers I want to order.. and most definitely I want to order the steak I want to order !!!!! I don't expect to be told what I am allowed to eat and drink.\\n\\nLastly, I expected a much higher level of customer service coming, not only from, a Gordon Ramsay restaurant, but Ceasar Groups sales force! Ms. Wendy Demay was not very helpful whatsoever, she did not offer any assistance, and was very unwilling to do anything other than push the 'Group Sales Contract'. Her lack of hospitality certainly does not leave me with  a very favorable first impression of the restaurant!\\n\\nHopefully my attempts today to contact someone directly at the restaurant will be better. \\n\\nI gotta say, so far I am very disappointed!

However, our chairs were rickety and appeared ready to collapse. \\n\\nThe restaurant was mostly empty (which was not a surprise as we got there after the prime lunch hour but before dinner).

And this is average - at best.  I'd say on par or slightly below Olive Garden.  It wasn't the worst food, but certainly not the best.  And again, I cannot overemphasize how below par the service was.   \\n\\nBut the thing which really upset me was when we got our check.  They charged us dinner prices for each of our meals.   Again, there is ONE menu, and the pack of the menu has the lunch section.  It reads (until 3:00 p.m.).   What I failed to see (because it's in fine print) is the part where they only offer lunch prices Monday through Friday.   Really?  REALLY?   Are you kidding me?   That's B.S., no matter how you view it.  At no time did either the hostess or the waitress bother to explain to us up front that the lunch pricing wasn't in effect.   \\n\\nI HATE being ripped off.

The seats and tables were the first thing I noticed since they're brightly colored and spattered with paint, but after that I realized I came to eat and not to stare at furniture, so I moved on to the menu, which was about as straightforward and simple as could be.\\n\\nI got a burrito, mainly since the tortillas looked amazing, with chicken, black beans, rice, etc. It's boring, but pretty much exactly what I get at Chipotle, and I wanted to compare. The sad part came when I got to the register, as it came to $10 and change without any of the additional options and a basic drink. Not bad if considering it as restaurant quality food, but as standard higher-end fast food, it gets into some dicey territory as far as price goes. \\n\\nThe drink area was surprisingly great, with a tons of choices and additional in-house teas, limeades, and even horchata. The burrito was great too. It was hot, the chicken was flavorful, and the tortilla turned out to taste as good as it looked. \\n\\nThe girlfriend on the other hand wasn't impressed. She got the two taco plate with beef, which was the same price, and I wouldn't be mentioning it if I didn't agree with her; the beef tacos were on a completely different level as the burrito. The tin foil they came in was full of grease, and the tacos were soaked in it. They were soggy and bland. Some grease is to be expected with beef, but this was a little overwhelming, and turned the tacos into a big wet glob of food. It would've been worth it if the beef had some substantial flavor, but they didn't.\\n\\nUltimately, the glory of the chicken burrito was not completely overshadowed by the greasy beef, although the tacos were admittedly bad. Would I pick it over a Chipotle burrito? Probably not. It was hotter and tasted great, but was also a bit smaller, more expensive, and more sloppily thrown together than what I get at Chipotle, with less topping options too. Definitely a decent place for some quick, fresh Mexican food, but I'm staying far away from the beef.",

No thanks, I don't want tripe & if the menu would have indicated it, I wouldn't have order it. I didn't get an apology or asked if I'd like something else. Instead, my father and I switched soups. Good thing my dad likes tripe..ick!\\nThe restaurant closes from 3-5 and two minutes after 3:00 a family came in and the server allowed them in but informed them that she was only allowing them to come in because they were a family.

The quality is not there and the blinds don't always open or close completely; some slats seem to stick in one position and we have to manually move them.  We never had this problem before.

We put our names on the list and went shopping around the area. About 25 minutes later, our table was ready. Parking was a cluster since the lot is shared with Dave & Busters and a karaoke bar called Sing Sing. Tom dropped me off at the door so I could secure our table.\\n\\nOur server, Jackie, approached me almost immediately and brought two waters to the table to start. She was very attentive and funny, and probably the best part of our experience at the restaurant. Tom ordered a Red Ale and to his surprise, didn't care for it. Jackie gave Tom three free samples of beers she thought he would like after talking to him about his beer drinking habits. He loved all three, and chose the most bizarre (and expensive) beer. Jackie switched the Red Ale to the beer of Tom's choice, and charged us for the less expensive beer. Very nice of her!\\n\\nWe started out with the Ball Park Pretzels with Jalapeno dip. The pretzels came out quickly and they were very fresh, not to mention huge! We only ate one and took the other to go. Very good app though! \\n\\nTom ordered some sort of bacon cheeseburger, and I got the Chicken Fried Chicken, which was a pounded chicken breast, breaded and fried, over white cheddar mashed potatoes with a side of gravy and some apple coleslaw.  Tom's burger came with a small handful of fries, and my meal was very spread out on my plate, like something was missing. Not very good presentation at all. The food itself was okay, nothing to write home about. The potatoes were my favorite part. Tom said that his burger was mediocre.\\n\\nAnother note: The bathrooms are shared with the Sing Sing karaoke bar that is in the same building, so expect drunk singing women in the bathrooms and brides-to-be puking in the stall next to you after enjoying too much alcohol at their bachelorette party...

I know you can do better as you have!  The original time I went here was a year ago for my Sister's 21st bday.  We sat in the outside patio area and had a blast!  The waitress was awesome, drink specials were decent and the atmosphere was great.  So when we were in Vegas for 4th of July weekend this year, again celebrating a 21st bday this time for my cousin, we were super excited to go back here.  It was a Sunday and they had all these advertisements for something like $10 all you can drink from 9pm-1am.  As it was almost 9pm we asked one of the hype women standing out front of the outside bar that was yelling about the special.   (I call them hype women as I don't think they were waitresses and they didn't know enough information to be a hostess.) They said yes come back at 9pm and for $10 we could drink until 1am.  PERFECT!  So we came back around 915pm and grabbed a seat at the outdoor bar.  Once we sat down the waitress came up and we inquired about the special.  This is where it went downhill, FAST!  She told us that the special wasn't for the outside bar it was only for inside.  Umm OK?!  So we went inside and asked the snotty hostess there about it.  She said she had no clue what were talking about to which we pointed to the sign right next to her stating the special.  She pointed us down the hall and said to ask down there.  We walked a few feet to another entrance.  Upon entering this rundown, hole-in-the-wall looking area we saw an empty bar to our right and a couple beer pong tables to our left and another bar behind them.  There was an employee moving tables and cleaning floors and then a few couples playing beer pong - no one else.  A waitress finally walked up to us to see if we needed help and we again brought up the promotion, which we found was Twitter driven so you had to become their Twitter fan in order to partake.  Side note here: I have done this type of promotion in Vegas before and they ALWAYS SUCK!  You will get every line in the book about why you aren't applicable - \\\"\"we ran out,\\\"\" \\\"\"We served all we can on that promotion,\\\"\" \\\"\" where did you see that at?\\\"\" etc, etc - it's only to get you in the door and they figure since you are there you will spend money!  Ok back to the terrible service at PBR - so the waitress gets the GM/Promoter of this special to help us.  This guy walks up to us doesn't introduce himself and is as cold as can be.  He asks what we need and we AGAIN repeat why we are there.  He asks if we all have a Twitter and we say yes and that we understand the promotion.  Then he looks to my cousin who is wearing a tank top and asks if he has another shirt to put on.  Now keep in mind it's July, in Vegas, and 120 degrees outside.  No my cousin says to him and the guys says Oh well then we can't serve you.  We inquire about the three guys playing beer pong ALL in tank tops and he says that they aren't here for that promotion.  WTF?! What do you have to wear a suit now to a rinky dink, drab bar in order to pay $10 to drink all  you want of their watered down well drinks?!  That was the last straw - we left all quite irritated.  If he didn't want to make the $50 he could have off of us and if he wanted to lessen the servers/bartenders tip money that night so be it.  If he is the person running this place I honestly want to have nothing to do with it.

We have ordered takeout from there several times since we live nearby and have witnessed the evolution of a new evolving business. I really enjoy the Beef Brisket sandwich along with the baked beans. I've eaten brisket in many places around the country and I find this sandwich to be right up there with the best (it keeps me coming back). I like spicy so I always get the extra spicy BBQ sauce on the side which is good in the beans to. \\n\\nI think this restaurant will improve over time as they get everyone trained and comfortable in their positions. It was mass confusion one of the first nights I was in there but the food was still great. We have gotten home on a couple of occasions to discover our order wasn't filled correctly (missing sides and an entree) which required calling and driving back. I bought a beef brisket sandwich one evening around 7 pm and returned home to eat it. Earlier my daughter said she didn't want BBQ but when I got home and she smelled it she asked if I could go back and get her one. I checked the hours they were open on the Internet and it said 10 pm. I was going to arrive around 8 pm so no problem. When I arrived the lights were still on but the door was locked. I could see employees inside cleaning up, it said 10 pm closing on the door and they were closed 2 hours prior. A wasted drive and disappointed daughter. \\n\\nI was there again last night early and the service and food was great. The owner greeted me. I think they will be a great addition to the local area.",

We had bottled beer and when we asked for glasses, we got the \\\"\"sure, I'll be right back\\\"\" then sat & waited...and waited.... Then when my boyfriend approached the bartender for said glasses, he received an eye roll for his trouble. At that point we contacted the others in our party who were meeting us there that we were heading over to OHSO instead. This was my first time at Arcadia Tavern and my last.",

It's absurdly overpriced at more than $50 a person for dinner. \\n\\nWhat do you get for that princely sum? \\n\\n*Some cold crab legs (it's NOT King Crab, either, despite what others are saying)\\n*Shrimp cocktail (several of which weren't even deveined.

We waited for an hour, thinking it would be worth it. We're suckers.\\n\\nThe prime rib was decent, however, and there was some really good mushroom risotto.

The only thing that could have made our experience worse is if we had coughed up the extra $12 to skip the line. \\n\\nThis only confirms my belief that the nicest hotels don't necessarily have the nicest buffets - the Bellagio buffet is no great shakes, either.

I hate the idea of writing a bad review because I'm empathetic toward small business owners. \\n\\nHowever, this restaurant seems to have enough unwarranted raving reviews for me not to feel guilty revealing the truth. I've lived in Vegas for 8 years and I have my regular sushi spots. The only reason I decided to try this joint was because it was a Friday night and my regular choices had a 1-2 hour wait. I remembered reading all of the positive reviews for this place so I decided to check it out. Maybe the fact that there was no wait at 8pm on a Friday night should have been the first indicator...\\n\\nThe service was really slow. The food took a VERY long time. My friend's spicy tuna roll took twice the time as one of our deep fried rolls. Our server was sweet and I had no problem with her demeanor but SHE was just as slow. I say this because there were several times that I saw our rolls sitting and waiting to be delivered for quite some time before she brought it over. The amaebi nigiri that I ordered was sitting on the counter for so long before I got it that the heads were completely cold and soggy. Strangely enough, the busser was EXTREMELY efficient...almost too efficient. It began to irritate me that they were so quick to clear the table but couldn't get any help to deliver the food. I know that sounds extremely critical but it just did not sit well with me. Again, the server was extremely nice and even apologetic for the slow service so she got her 20% tip but I was a server for years...I'm not sure if others would be as patient.\\n\\nNow I am usually forgiving of slow service if the taste is worth the wait. In this case, the taste was definitely not worth ANY wait. The rice was too watery and ruined the taste of the rolls. The sashimi did not taste fresh and some of it even lacked any taste at all. I ordered the uni and it was literally stale and dried up. This may be one of the worst sushi places I have ever been to just based on taste. Additionally, the AYCE menu is limited in comparison to others in city. Natto and toro were not included on the AYCE. Toro I can understand but why not the Natto? Same goes for the side orders.\\n\\nThere are much better options in town for sushi. I Love Sushi is probably one of the best in town and I would suggest Yama Sushi or Sushi-Mon for AYCE over this place any day. You just have to be willing to wait to be seated...but there's a reason people are lining up to eat there.",

His staff acts so busy, but they are all seemingly having enough time to chat with each other vs. calling people.

Not only has the weekly pool service been shoddy at best, but the company is completely unresponsive to its customers. The first week of service, the pool tech left our hose on in our pool, and we didn't discover this until we came home later in the evening, with the pool almost overflowing. The second week, we noticed that our pool vacuum was no longer working, and when I mentioned it to the tech, he said he'd bring the parts to our house the following week. The next week came, and the tech (who was a different person than the week before) said he didn't know about the broken vacuum, but that he'd call it in and we could get it fixed. We heard nothing after that. \\n\\nWhen I finally called the office to see when we could get the vacuum fixed, I had to call three times over the course of a week before the owner left me a voicemail to tell me the price of the repair. When I tried to schedule service thereafter, it took two more phone calls over the course of 4 days to schedule the repair person to come. In the interim, our pool turned green, was covered in algae, and frankly looked worse than when the pool went unattended for a month while our house was vacant. \\n\\nDuring the next visit, the pool tech left the backflow hose out across the yard, draped over some plants in the backyard. The water from the backflow caused rocks from our landscaping to scatter over the patio and caused water damage to some boxes we had stored in the area. \\n\\nI have attempted to cancel our service and request a refund for the remainder of the month, but have heard no response.

A few highlights from the letter: \\\"\"I am so concerned we can't meet your expectations of customer service I made a note in your customer profile so we can decline to service your vehicle should you accidentally call us again.\\\"\" and \\\"\"Instead of being happy you received services discounted over $200 you complain...we call customers like you \\\"\"Someone Else's' customer\\\"\".

They have the customer service part down. HOWEVER, the rest of my experience there would lead me to not go back. As a part of the oil change special they also did a bunch of free inspections (i.e. ways to find other things to get you to pay for). With my car they found three things. The windshield wipers were indeed bad, so I had them replaced for about $30, which I was fine with, though the replacements they put on seem a bit flimsy. But, the other two were ridiculous. Worse of the two was them telling me my taillight was out and it would be $35 to replace the bulb. First of all, that's a crazy high price, but worse yet is that there was NOTHING wrong with my taillight! There is a wiring problem, so since the summer my car's dashboard keeps saying the taillight is out, but if they took the two seconds to actually check if the light was working or not as I did later that night, they would've seen there was no problem. The fact that they just saw the message and were going to charge me $35 to fix a non-existent problem really irritates me. The second thing they said was that my brakes were 90% worn down and I should shell out $1,000 (!!!) to have them exchanged. I don't really see an issue with my brakes now, and from the research I've done it should not cost 1 grand to replace brakes. I think their laziness on the brake light is what is going to keep me from coming here again, no matter their deal on oil changes.

For those of you, like me, who aren't sure what roti bread is- its much lighter than pita bread and a little thinner than a tortilla. Its very tasty. The hummus was very good, and they garnished it with diced tomatoes, onions and cilantro which i loved!\\n\\nWe also ordered the seared eggplant. It was AWESOME. It was a large slab of eggplant with a black sauce that was herby (thats a technical term in case you were wondering). They also served the egglplant with a yellow sauce drizzled on the plate which was sweet and very good, in addition to a small scoop of a red chili sauce (our waitress told me the name and I couldnt remember it for the life of me) which was spicy...I really loved this sauce it was the perfect amount of spice for the eggplant. \\n\\nI will be going back here to try the curry and some of the other things on the menu i cant pronounce. \\n\\nThere are a LOT of vegetarian/vegan dishes clearly marked on the menu.

        "ori": "Wow. I was seriously impressed with this place. This place ranks second to French Laundry on my list of favorites. \\n\\nFirst- if you are a first time visitor there, I would recommend just ordering off of the menu. I am sure the Omakase is great but you have to try the signature dishes- and you may not get to try them all with the Omakase. \\n\\nSecond- don't have the sushi be your primary focus. It's okay- but the other items are so much better. We saw people around us doing nothing but order sushi- what a waste! \\n\\nThird- the warm dishes tended to be larger portions than the cold and raw dishes. Just a FYI if you want to budget your appetite and your wallet. I also felt that the dishes with a tart factor (see below) were too overwhelming. I would pass on these- IMO the tartness is so much you can't enjoy the other flavors that might be there. \\n\\nWe started with edammame and the sheshito peppers. Pass on the edamamme - there is nothing great about it- and you don't need to fill up your tummy with average stuff. The sheshito peppers were really good. They taste like small green bell peppers and the miso and sesame sauce on top has a great flavor. My husband is so picky when it comes to veggies and he even enjoyed this. My only word of caution- occasionally you get a spicy one! \\n\\nSo we relied on our fellow yelpers and ordered the following items: \\n\\n1. Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - definitely get this- it was awesome! \\n\\n2. The blackened miso cod- by far, the highlight of the evening \\n\\n3. Chilean sea bass- cooked the special of the day way (yummy)- it had tomatoes, and onions, some white wine sauce \\n\\n4. Kobe beef on skewers- pass- it was okay but not great \\n\\n5. Lobster Ceviche- pass- the tartness was way too overwhelming \\n\\n6. Red snapper with dry miso - pass- again, tartness too overwhelming \\n\\n7. Then we ordered some basic filler items- tempura, sushi (CA rolls and Ama Ebi)- all which were fine. \\n\\n8. We ordered the bento box dessert- it was ok- not fantastic. \\n\\nOverall- the meal was great. The black miso cod was so good- it had the right blend of sweetness with saltiness, and the fish was so tender it literally melts in your mouth. The Chilean sea bass had the same texture and effect, but it costs about twice the amount as the black cod (a tidbit for those of you who are watching the $$s). \\n\\nWe had starved ourselves earlier in the day and were totally stuffed by the end of the meal. The whole meal with tip was just over $300. I highly recommend this place. It was the only restaurant that we went to in the older part of Vegas that was great.",

The food was outstanding from start to finish. A trendy decor perfectly at home in the Cosmo proved to be the perfect setting for a style of dining that encourages a communal experience.\\n\\nThe menu spans multiple regions of Spain and showcases some of their most popular cuisine. Jam\\u00f3n ib\\u00e9rico and paella are probably the best known dishes to an American audience but Jaleo's menu goes far beyond the staples offering a unique mix with something for every palate.\\n\\nThe Good: Jaleo's menu features a number of different paellas, but keep in mind that they rotate on a nightly basis, also make sure to order them early as they take 45 minutes to prepare. We opted for the vegetable paella which was packed with flavor. The rice was a perfect al-dente and had a nice bite to it. The portion was a bit on the small side so be sure to order 2 if you have a larger group. The Jam\\u00f3n ib\\u00e9rico did not disappoint either. Sliced paper-thin, the fat marbled ham had a great saltiness finished with hit of acorn. Another standout were the Croquetas De Pollo (chicken fritters). They weren't unlike risotto balls I've had in the past with a molten cheese center. They were a nice balance to the bold, spicy flavors of the other dishes. Ultimately you really can't go wrong with anything on Jaleo's menu. We sampled about 10-12 dishes total and they were all outstanding. Be sure to start your meal with one of the restaurant's signature gin and tonics.\\n\\nThe Bad: Nothing bad to report. We did have to wait an extra 15 minutes past our reservation to be seated, but the friendly bar tenders took good care of us while we waited. The service was also a bit slow, but that's more attributed to just how busy the restaurant was. Make sure you book a table in advance.\\n\\nJaleo is a quintessentially Vegas dining experience. It's great for groups and the vibrant atmosphere and stunning food will keep me coming back.",

The appetizers, salads and the meals arrived in a very timely fashion. I took the advice from the review by Gary T. and had the Grigliata Di Pesce ( Lobster tail, Salmon, Shrimp, Scallops, Tuna and Chilian Sea Bass Sauteed Spinach, Potatoes drizzled with lemon sauce) and was grilled just enough to get the grilled taste. He was correct about the $40.00 price tag. It was worth every penny. My wife shared a lamb chop dinner with her mother and asked if one of the three lamb chops could be cooked different. The lamb chops arrived cooked perfectly and tasted great. Two were cooked well done and one cooked medium rare. These guys also made the evening special with a birthday dessert for my mother in law.

I'm pretty picky, which I believe is justified after some of the terrible stylists I've had.  I have finally figured out that Yelp is a pretty great tool to use when searching for feedback and experiences for certain things.  So on I went, Yelp actually suggested Snapdragon Salon when I was checking out another place.  I read all of the great reviews and decided to go their website.  After doing a bit of research, checking out the stylists I put a call in.  \\n\\nSo here's the thing, I got VERY lucky to be seen as quickly as I did.  I called on a Thursday, I was in seeing Jenny for a consultation Friday morning!  Jenny was extremely friendly and after explaining what my ideas were she mentioned doing their hair model program.  I of course excitedly said a resounding, YES!  I mean, who wouldn't want to have their hair corrected/colored for a very low cost.  If you are asked to model, DO IT.  It may be a teaching tool, but no worries if you have any, the stylist being instructed is led by a seasoned stylist so nothing can go wrong :)\\n\\nThe first step was getting in to have my sad, sad hair cut.  Michaela took my hair from split ends and heavy weight to light, layered and flowing.  All without losing the length I've been so studiously growing out for the past four years.  The haircut not only looked great, it cut my drying time down in half.  Just days later I came back to receive the second installment of my styling.  I gave these ladies quite the challenge and they definitely rose to the occasion!  In the past year I had moved to Virginia and could never find a stylist I loved so I kept swapping around, which led to crazy amounts of different highlights, lowlights, bands, splotches etc.  They had a mess to clean up.  Kandy and Stephanie teamed up and created a work of art!  This review is already so long, that I couldn't possibly even go into detail of what they did.  What I can say is they went way above and beyond to make my hair look spectacular.  I think one of my favorite parts is that I was able to listen in as Kandy instructed, and it gave me a huge appreciation for how much talent, artistic eye, and forethought it takes to make sure someone's hair turns out perfect.  \\n\\nIf you are considering going here, GO!!

I am also a friend of hers, because our friendship developed over the course of time she did my hair. This is important for me to share because I will visit her in Arizona. This is relevant because I will book an appointment with her at Shampoo Ink when I do.\\n\\nMY HAIR STORY:\\nI have naturally dark brown hair, and I dyed it black. Four months later I decided to be a pain in the ass and go from black to blonde, so I let a stylist friend do it. He has been doing hair for 25 years, so I figured it was fine.\\n\\nLong story short, by the time I realized I needed to stop seeing him, my hair was dark red on the top, light brown on the ends, there were chunks of blondish color going from top to bottom, harsh lines at my roots, and completely uneven.\\n\\nEnter Brittany, suggested by a mutual friend and client.\\n\\nBrittany is a hair wizard. \\n\\nShe was shocked by the state of my hair, but she was able to work with it. And not just work with it, but make it blonde. Make it even. Make it BEAUTIFUL. I'm posting pictures (before and afters) so you can see her incredible skills. \\n\\nMy hair has been killer ever since I started seeing her. But then of course she had to go and move to Arizona! Before she left, we talked about how I have been very hesitant to trust another stylist to touch up my hair, so we agreed that my last appointment with her would be more of an ombre so as the roots grew out I wouldn't look insane. \\n\\nWell, it's been almost two months since she has moved (and about the same time I've been overdue for an appointment) and I still get compliments on my hair. The grow-out still looks nice, and quite frankly, there is no one else in Atlanta that I trust to work with my blonde hair. So either I will keep it like this until I see her again, or I'll have to go back to brown. \\n\\nThat is how incredible of an artist she is. And I have no problem giving this salon five stars, because if Brittany is the type of the staff they hire, then this is an excellent salon.\\n\\nShampoo Ink... you guys are so fortunate.

It's in the commercial area of the Camelview condo development.  Went there for the first time last Saturday night after a long, long drive from California.  Josh and the entire staff was so friendly and welcoming that it lifted my bad mood.  The menu is fun because you pick one type of meat and the rest is literally the Cook's Surprise.  They do check to see what you WILL NOT eat so you won't be served anything you're not accustomed to. Four courses for $45, if you would like it paired with their wine selections, it's another $20 bucks.  Yes, $65 is not cheap but it's very reasonable for this innovative menu prepared especially for you. It won't help for me to describe the dishes because it will be different for you anyways.

Lets start w/ the day party - 2 stars - came through on Friday July 4th after we all landed. First the foolishness at the door with the hardcore I.D.'ing and lines to get on lines, even though we were on the guestlists and we're a group of girls. Prejudice from other staff members of our own color, were giving us a hard time and power tripping. Once upstairs the asian bartender was a total turd, we ordered gummi bear shots from her, she misheard and gave us some minty shyt that tasted like scope, she had an attitude problem when we told her it was wrong and we wanted her to change them to what we ordered, as if WE did something wrong, cause its our fault that the music was too loud and she couldn't hear us? Ok, so then she goes and tattle tales on herself to management before we go and speak to them ourselves, cause she wanted to soften her own story by telling it herself and still wanted to charge us to change the shots, cause naturally someone shot it all since they're supposed to be shots. Duh. Anyways, we finally got our correct shots after some back and forth, but it was a total buzz kill to deal with her sourness, especially when the party was already dying down. We had started our day so happy and ready to party, they completely harassed us down to were we just left. Came back again Tuesday to kill time before our flights and it was such a dead zone. Had lobster tacos, they were ok, light, small, nothing too flavorful. Both times they played awful EDM, no house at least, no switching up, no classics, just super niche electronic shyt. Marquee dayclub staff and management is super weak, and you would think they would conduct themselves better with new, hipper, sexier competitors like Drais taking the majority of their crowd.\\n\\nAs for the night club - 4 stars - we had a good time there last year, and a great time there again this year on a monday night after the 4th of july holiday weekend. Got through on the guestlist with no harassment this time. But also worth noting we got there really early, like 10-11ish. Was supposedly their industry night, we stayed in the boombox room with hip hop. Music and mixing was good, everyone was dancing, tons of groups of cool girls ready to have good clean dancey fun. We were some of the first to arrive, some sponsors got us tons of white gummibear shots so we were feeling nice again. Place got packed, music was great, Lebron James was in the building, things got good, cause we forced it up to be so. But originally the girl bartender was super nervous to make our normal drinks properly during the open bar because of \\\"\"cameras\\\"\". Same with a guy tender at another bar downstairs, and he was of course more rude about it. Management needs to empower and encourage their barstaff to apply discernment independently for situations, 3 hot ladies celebrating a birthday and bachelorette, shouldnt have to negotiate for well made drinks, especially at the given pricepoints. You would get so much more money giving people proper drinks, cause then theyre feeling buzzed and enjoying themselves and want to stay longer and spend more money. Stop being so effing cheap on the liqs and making your staff so scared and bitchy, or if the struggle is so real, dont have an open bar then. And your door shouldnt be armed to the tooth by assholes. They should have the good sense to let the party girls into to party. Lighten up marquee, you're really not that hot and you're losing your audience to other hotter, better staffed and better managed spots on the strip.",

        "ori": "The store is really great if looking for equipment for outdoor activities.\\n\\nBut the store is really inconveniently placed in an area where it is difficult to get to if someone does not have a car and needs to take public transportation. The prices are not too bad; it is adequate and reasonable for the quality, size and type of equipment being displayed.\\n\\nBut the reason I give this MEC store 3 stars is that despite an adequate/decent range of products they sell, the customer service is severely lacking. Whenever I go, there seems to be employees everywhere, but only when you don't need them or have any questions. Either that or if you ask an employee a question, they would tell you that they will get someone for you who specializes in that department, and no one would ever come afterwards. Almost as if they never called someone for you (empty promises) or they just plain forgot about the customers.\\n\\nOne time, I rode my bike all the way to the store (one hour bike ride), so that I could buy and get bike baskets installed on my bike. I asked the bike installation/repairmen how the service would work, so they told me to choose what I liked, and consult them before buying. After choosing a basket, the employee was gone. When I asked another bike employee, he said that I had to unlock my bike from outside the store and bring it in-store for him to assess if he could install it for me. When I came back in with my bike, there were no employees again. When I asked a random employee passing by to help, he 'could not help because he did not know anything about bikes' but he would get me a specialist. After waiting 20 minutes, a bike specialist happened to come by and was unaware of my situation and was oblivious to the fact that there was a growing line of other customers who needed their own bikes to be fixed or get something installed behind me. When I asked him if he could help, he said that he was busy filling up an order and that I nor the other customers behind me was not his responsibility and walked off into the back employee room. After about another 15 minute wait and lots of complaining to non-bicycle specialist employees, a bike specialist employee finally came out from his break and just threw me a random product and told me to go install it at home myself. When I told him I would be willing to pay extra and wait for the store to install it for me, he said that the store already has too many jobs to complete and was already behind on everything. I was fed up at that point and eventually had to buy it and figure out how to do it myself.\\n\\nHonestly, as much as I love browsing around the store and looking at the the equipment, I would only visit the store for that purpose: browsing. I would not trust the store/employees for any services, because they are completely unreliable!\\n\\nSometimes, I would be browsing their online website for products and I would be interested in seeing it in front of me. So I would call the store to make sure that the store had it (an item) in stock, sometimes the are in stock so I go out of my way to go to the store but I find that the employees I ask to locate the item for me has never even heard of it or the item has been out of stock for weeks.\\n\\nAll in all, the store itself has a lot of potential but the people working for the company needs a serious regrouping or just plain replacement as a whole.",

Ordered a large meatball (homemade and they were the best part) for about $16. Pizza wasn't cooked enough because the cheese shifted on the way home creating somewhat of a cheese tidal wave in one corner of the box. It looked good, but there was major issues with the crust. It was off and it didn't look like NY crust, it was breaking apart in the box and although it was foldable, too much cheese made it not a great fold after all. Basically, the bottom of the pizza was somehow undercooked as well and it just didn't work out well.

First of all, sitting upstairs is an entirely different experience from sitting downstairs. It's so much prettier and more regal to sit downstairs (we were upstairs and it almost felt like a bar setting). Second of all, the service was absolutely terrible. When I wanted more bread, I had to ask at least 3 times. We waited over an hour between our appetizers and entrees. We were all starving and our food and waiter were no where to be found. Although we enjoyed the conversation among our table, it was a bit ridiculous that our meal (not a tasting menu) lasted 2.5+ hours (and most of the time we spent ravenous waiting four our food). The food itself was good, but not spectacular. The lamb taco was lacking flavor. The sword fish was very good, but there were two tiny pieces of sausage in the entire dish. The seafood platter was good, but the center of my scallop was cold and the salmon had an extremely strong flavor. The crab cake was delicious and was basically pure crab meat with no filler. One of my dining partners got the chicken dish and one got the lamb chop - both said they were only \\\"\"okay.\\\"\" The desserts were fairly good (we tried the peach cannoli, a peach dish with blueberry ice cream, and a chocolate dessert). When we wanted the check, our waiter was no where to be found. We looked over downstairs and he was shmoozing on the floor below. Overall, it was a mediocre experience. I much prefer the other Big Burrito restaurants, which is unfortunate because I was so excited for my experience at Eleven.

Her insurance had to take care of the repairs because it was her fault. I own a Toyota, so I had asked Allstate if Desert Toyota could do the work. They told me it was possible, but because they weren't affiliated with them, approvals and repairs would end up taking a little longer. At the end, I just decided to go with their recommended body shop, which was here at Park Place Infiniti.\\n\\nI gotta admit, I was skeptical at first. I mean, I have a Toyota, so why would it get repaired by Infiniti? Chris helped me when I got there and was very nice. I felt kind of bad for him because he is the only one running the front office area and he was busy. I gave him the paperwork that Allstate gave me, he inspected my car, then told me that they would order a new rear bumper right away. I dropped my car off 3 days later, when the bumper came in. He quoted me that the repair would be finished in 3 business days. It actually took only 2 days, which was awesome. This was probably a simple fix for them, but I thought they did a good job anyway. The bumper was installed correctly and the paint job looked good. Also, they washed and cleaned the inside of my car! Thanks guys, for the super clean carpets!\\n\\nRight before I left, Chris told me that Allstate may call me and ask about the service I received from them. He said that if there was any reason that I wasn't satisfied, to decline the survey and let him know because he and his team want to know how they can improve. But, I told him that he didn't have to worry about that! Great customer service and fast repair time. Definitely recommended!",

I could be wrong, but they seem to use mozzarella chunks, not cheese curds, which were also cold. The meal started out really well. Then came the pizzas...\\n\\nWe got small Guinea and Back Home Pies. Online pricing is wrong btw they were $13 each not $12, but even the wee size was pretty big. You can easily feed 2 with the wee because of how filling the super thick crust is. It was like an equally greasy, but not as crispy version of Pizza Hut pan pizza. \\n\\nThey're really generous with the cheese, but stingy as hell with the toppings. This 2nd location recently opened, but don't believe the older pics from the Arville location or their online menu pics, it's super misleading. What they show on one slice is about what you get on half the pizza. The Guinea pie had MAYBE half a meatball on the entire thing, but was loaded with ricotta, mozzarella and spinach. Really dumb because the meatball is cheaper than the cheeses. The moisture from all that spinach also made the crust really soggy. The Guinea sounded awesome, but wasn't. The garlic white sauce also was extremely bland. \\n\\nBack Home was a little better - crust was super crispy in the beginning, but soggy after the first piece. Again, really generous with cheese, and short on sausage and pepperoni. It was better than the Guinea, but still not very good - soggy pretty quickly and literally dripping with grease. \\n\\nService was great even though there was only 1 person doing the counter, phone orders and playing waitress. She was sweet and attentive. \\n\\nAlso their tables are ridiculously small. Do not sit at a 2 top because the pizza pan takes up basically the entire table. They need to invest in the stands that most other pizza places have. \\n\\nI would return for take out on poutine and to try their loaded fries, and maybe the sandwiches. But I am not at all a fan of their pizza. I'd recommend this place if you're with a group and looking for value, but keep in mind that you're only filling up on bread and grease.

        "ori": "Like many regular customers of the Mellow Mushroom on Selwyn, we were thrilled when we heard there was going to be a location closer to us in Ballantyne.  This review is based on our first three experiences at the new Ballantyne location. I have rated each visit separately below. My overall 2-star rating is based on a composite of all 3 trips there.\\n\\nVisit #1 (3 stars)\\nWe first visited the new location a few days after they opened.  We expected that within the first few days, some things would be slower than normal and that's fine. We entered and found the lobby area to be chaos with people milling around either waiting to be seated or trying to figure out how/where to get takeout. \\n\\nSeating:  We were finally seated after a reasonable wait. They took us to a section in the back near the kitchen. It's behind a wall and underneath the stairs. DO NOT ever let them seat you there. It was very loud and very cramped. There was a large group behind us and we might as well have been sitting at their table. I had to move my chair to the side of our table because as it was set up, the servers kept bumping into me every time they walked past. It's just really not a great set up.  The server was pleasant, but before we even ordered, she warned us twice that the kitchen was going to be very slow. OK, the warning was good and understandable for the first week.\\n\\nFood:  Here is where we made our mistake. We ordered a 14 inch pizza but asked for some extra cheese. Just a bit extra, but not double the normal cheese. The pizza came out about 40 minutes later (slow kitchen) and was horrendous. There was so much cheese and sauce that you couldn't pick up a slice. It was not good, but in the kitchen's defense, we did ask for extra cheese. We ate with fork & knife because it was the only way to eat the goopy mess. Lesson learned:  No extra cheese.  Overall, we left unsatisfied with the pizza, but figured it was partially our own fault for asking for something different.\\n\\nVisit #2 (5 stars)\\nOur second trip was fantastic. We were seated quickly upstairs and the atmosphere was 100x better than the corner they put us in the previous time. Our server was friendly and fairly attentive. A manager stopped by to ask us how everything was.  The pizza (same order as last time, but WITHOUT the extra cheese) was perfect. It was the pizza we had come to expect from the Selwyn location.  All was good and we looked forward to our next visit.\\n\\nVisit #3 (0 stars)\\nIt became very clear to us in our third visit that this restaurant is understaffed and overwhelmed.  Our third visit was greeted by the same entry area chaos as the first visit.  We were finally seated in a nice booth to the left side of the restaurant. Our server was friendly and attentive.  We ordered the exact same pizza as in visit #2 that we enjoyed so much.  The pizza took 45 minutes to arrive and our server kept coming by to apologize for the delays. The booth behind us was complaining constantly to the server about the wait.  The table to our side was served salad without dressing and had to wait a long time to get the dressing.  But, back to our pizza. Remember how wonderful it was in visit #2?  It was nearly unrecognizable.  The cheese was a soupy mess and there was a huge puddle of oil/grease in the center.  The cheese and sauce didn't go near the edges, so the crust was huge sections of bubbled dough with no toppings. We told our server that it didn't look good and she agreed.  Because we were in a hurry (and had already waited 45 minutes for the pizza), we decided to make the best of it and try to eat it.  The server said she would get a manager to come by. The manager never came. We did our best to eat the pizza. If I was MM management, I would be embarrassed to serve that pizza. We finally got our check and found that they had comped us for one soda.  Not the pizza, not two sodas.  One soda. Still no manager.  I asked for a to-go cup for my soda before we left and the server said she would get me one. Apparently, my request was rhetorical because we never saw the server again. \\n\\nIf this was our first trip there, we would never return. It was that bad. I hope management gets stuff ironed out quickly. It's apparent that the entry area needs to be changed/improved. They may want to move the takeout orders to the end of the bar or further from the masses waiting to be seated. Most disturbing so far has been the wild inconsistency in the pizza. We plan to give it another try at some point because we know how good it can be. Overall, it's only 2 stars for us.",

We went on a Tuesday for lunch and there was a pretty long wait which was a good sign.  We got to the front, paid the 22 dollars and got quickly seated.  Server promptly took our order and we were off to the races.\\n\\nThe carver stations had st. louis ribs and flank steak which were both pretty good.  And those were the only two redeeming dishes at the buffet.  We tried the spicy tuna handroll and it was packed with red pepper flakes which didn't go over so well.  The selection was really lacking (in comparison to the new buffets on the block like Wicked Spoon and Caesar's).  For sushi, there was only the tuna handrolls, a veggie roll and a california roll.  The asian food section had 1 shu mai, some rice porridge, fried rice and chinese veggies.  \\n\\nThe last time I was here, Bellagio was the best.

We each ordered the two piece dinner and we each got 3 pieces.. even after I commented, when ordering, that I could only eat one piece so hubby should order one less than he wants 'cause he was getting my extra one.  So.. I ate 1 piece, hubby ate 4, one too many.  Breading was nicely spiced on each, the catfish was fantastic.\\n\\nHubby was curious about their appetizers so I told him to go ahead and order 1.. he ordered two, and there were huge quantities of both.  The mac & cheese balls (fried) and the sweet corn balls (fried).  Let me say this, with the fried catfish and fried okra, I was thinking that more fried foods would put me into a coma... but they were both fantastic!  Breading on both was very minimal, and they were incredibly good.  The sweet corn balls had extra honey in them, they should be classified as a dessert.\\n\\nOnly drawbacks.. baked beans were boring, not much flavor difference from a can of pork & beans from the grocery shelf.  Then there was their tartar sauce.. it was homemade and very good, but you get a very tiny quantity of it served with the order, making a request for more tartar sauce obligatory.\\n\\nWhen we were leaving, after bemoaning the fact that they're such a long drive from our house, we got informed that they're opening up another location this summer near our house.. I'd have hugged the guy for that info if I wasn't already slipping into my fried-food coma.  Look for them opening sometime this summer at the NW corner of Craig & Decatur! :D",

Simply put, they're hard prices to beat: a spinach-feta pizza and a gyro(big enough that I didn't even make it to the pizza) cost me $11 after tax. \\n\\nThe gyro was excellent, and though not enough to usurp my stomach's other Big Fat Greek champion(My Big Fat Greek Gyro), the price and convenience of this place easily makes up for it.  The pizza had a very thin crust and had a nice seasoning to it. Toppings weren't skimped on, but I had a little trouble finding the feta on the slice I did attempt. They also threw tomatoes on it for free, because the guy on the phone thinks they're a nice touch, and, I did too.\\n\\nShockingly, BFG didn't replace Salt as my favorite restaurant in this stretch of Penn ave, but for cheap sandwich while I'm working from home or for a pizza dinner when I don't feel like cooking, this is a great place to have in the neighborhood",

Done and Done!\\n\\nWe stopped by the hotel to change and take a shower and I could feel my salivary glands beginning to get happy. \\\"\"Oh boy! The best brewpub in Montreal!? How could it be?\\\"\" \\n\\nWe took the metro and walked about a half mile to an unassuming pub with a small deck in front. It was packed when we walked in. Along the wall was a large chalk board with 20 beers that I was told rotate regularly listed with alcohol content.\\n\\nThe place seated about 50 people and every table was packed, (They are only open from 3 PM -3 AM, so that is why I missed it the three times we walked by it earlier in the week.)

I think Montreal citizens have their 2 beers to warm up, and then go to dinner. \\n\\nI ordered the Belgium IPA, not too assertive, just the right amount of \\\"\"Belgiumy\\\"\" (Clovey, spicy, lots going on) I then ordered an English IPA. came out in a 2 oz English Pint. Yummy, understated, but flavorful at the same time. Kind of like a strong ESB. good stuff.\\n\\nMy last beer was the black IPA, it tasted like a strong Guinness. I could tell the brewer knew their beer. I could taste the love in every sip. The coffee, roasted flavor came through in full force without the nitrogen fizziness. A solid 10 beer.\\n\\nBig glasses (10 Oz) were $6, not bad for Montreal (Which really sucked for beer prices), and for AMAZING beer.\\n\\nI also ordered the tuna panini. I was expecting a gloppy tuna Americanized salad, but it was just tuna from a can, some anchovies (YUM), some spices and warmed. The only drawback for the place was it wasn't toasted well enough, but I really wasn't here for the food. Not bad, not great.\\n\\nMy wife got the pretzel, which was small, but she really enjoyed it. Dipped in some spicy mustard, I was happy with my bite.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice and served us just fine, but my wife ordered a second pretzel and she forgot to put the order in. No big deal.

Instead it feels like every side-stairway COULD be the stairway you're meant to take, but then it isn't, but the one you DO take isn't that obvious.\\n\\nSo now it's enter, turn left, go down small stairs, ignore first set of stairs on left, ignore second set on right, turn a corner, keep going, turn another corner, go to end of corridor, ignore scaffolding, go left, left again and then down the OTHER stairs you used to take before they blocked of Princes Street entrance except now that entrance is open again in case you didn't get the memo.\\n\\nBut, as the final cherry on the cake, don't forget the very purpose of this building and why people enter. To catch a train. What is it with going for the train that means people usually leave minus two minutes to get it on time, without having to run down the platform? Yes, people are often late and yes they are panicked and snappy and pushy and suddenly forget all their manners. Survival of the fittest, Darwin's evolution in its finest form -catching the London train from platform 1.\\n\\nWHERE THE FRICK IS PLATFORM 1?!\\n\\nOnce you've gotten through the aforementioned temporary labyrinth (which I get the feeling is like the Cube in Cube, that may change day-on-day but it looks the same so you'll never know...) some platforms are over or under or around a bridge that get to from the main concourse.\\n\\nYes, it is charming at the best of times and it probably inspired J K Rowling to write Harry Potter with the platform X and 3/4 and if you know your way around it, it can provide amusing people watching when you see new-comers and tourists look slightly perplexed.\\n\\nBut until all the 'improvements' and building works are done it's only going to be a constant source of frustration for EVERYONE. Add this onto the fact that Princes Street is a disaster due to the new-mode-of-transport-that-will-not-be-named-but-cost-us-a-billion-pounds and it makes for very unhappy commuters.\\n\\nPhew.

It create a play of complimenting and contrasting flavors that collectively make the experience. If forced to find standout dishes:\\n\\nIssan Sausage (a grilled sour pork sausage.  The natural sweetness of the pork shines through in this simple yet perfectly balanced sausage).\\n\\nSua Rong Hai (broiled beef tenderloin in a spicy, sweet sauce.  Tender with the spices bringing out the sweetness of the beef).\\n\\nPlar Dook Kar-Prow Krob (Deep fried whole catfish topped with saut\\u00e9ed fresh chili, garlic, and basil.

The charbroiling adds a good bitterness).\\n\\nGarlic prawns (lightly battered, deep fried with shells on in a fresh, peppery garlic sauce.  Just good eats).\\n\\nMassive wine list (Wine Spectator Best Award of Excellence) with over 600 selections.  Heavy emphasis on Germany and France (Rieslings).  Very inexpensive.\\n\\nAnd to the annoying ladies dining next to us commenting on our unrefined choice of utensils and wasteful over ordering:  (1) Thai etiquette dictates you use your fork to put food on your spoon and only put your spoon in your mouth,  (2) you don't ask for chopsticks, and (3) it is rude not to leave some food on the serving dishes and your plate.\\n\\nAlways a great culinary adventure.",

Honestly, I think Honey Bears is far better. There are several flaws with this place. The pulled pork comes with NO BBQ sauce; yes it's served dry and mushy and you have to apply your own. I've never been to a BBQ place where the pulled pork is not served in sauce. The ribs are tiny and the meat does not fall off the bone; the meat is actually quite tough. For pork ribs, the meat is supposed to fall of the bone and be tender and succulent. The baked beans had no flavor. \\n\\nThere is no chicken on the menu, only turkey.\\n\\nThe sauce itself is underwhelming. They seem to be preoccupied with the idea that \\\"\"heat\\\"\" or spiciness makes for a better sauce. And that couldn't be further from the truth. We are talking about BBQ sauce not salsa. The best sauces have flavor not heat. Their \\\"\"sissy\\\"\" sauce was actually their better sauce. Their \\\"\"original sauce\\\"\" has too much crushed red pepper and almost has salsa like undertones.\\n\\nFinally, the fact that you don't get a container of sauce when you order take-out is bush league. They have these tiny packets of sauce that resemble tiny packets of butter or margarine at a diner.  Any respectable BBQ establishments gives you a container of sauce to go with your food. And unfortunately, you need more than a container since their food is pretty dry and devoid of sauce. \\n\\nSorry but Phoenix deserves better.",

I wouldn't call our music style quite contemporary in that when someone says \\\"\"contemporary Christian music\\\"\" I immediately think of Chris Tomlin, Brandon Heath, etc., and it's more of a gospel sound, if you have heard of The Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir our music is pretty much exactly the same. We do have a lot of energy in not only our worship but also some during the sermon. We have wonderful ministries for people of all ages, in church, out in the community, and around the world with our great missions department. The most common drawback for people is how big the church is. With over 8,000 members (I of course don't know exacts), and plenty who are not yet members, it can be overwhelming for someone used to smaller congregations. However we offer a shuttling service for satellite parking at both Providence and Country Day School if you want to skip out on the crowded parking lot, and the bus drops you off right at the front door of our sanctuary. Also if you feel that you can't get connected because of he huge crowd in services here's where our said ministries on campus comes in. We have many different options with Sunday school classes you can attend, not just by age or \\\"\"single\\\"\" or \\\"\"coues, but also different subjects (which I don't really know off the top of my head).

I'm not an expert but I eat sushi almost every day and I know a tiny bit about things and even though Sushi Kee has their own way of making and preparing their sushi, I have had better elsewhere.

Which by the way I loved, got the Yukon Gold Potato Pizza, but for that I'll add to the various Parlor threads. I'm definitely a pizza neophyte when trying to explore beyond what the to-go places, streets of new york, nypd, etc. Unfortunately, didn't realize they were a 5-10 place!\\n\\nWandering around Mill Ave and realizing the 202 was approaching, decided to stop at this corner restaurant. It's huge! The parking lot and entrance seem to have a very weird relationship however, and the myriad unmarked doors, little alleyways inside the building made me a little leery, but also induced a sense of adventure, as if I was exploring some mysterious castle. A little fun in and of itself, but not quite what I want to feel before I walk into a restaurant. After finding the entrance however, I was entranced by the history this restaurant proclaims. The hostess (mind you, this is around 1:40pm) said that someone would be with me shortly, which was a little weird because no one was in the restaurant, but I didn't mind because there is so much to distract you. Articles, history, guns everywhere, a little bar area, curtained rooms, partitioned rooms for what I fantasize secret meetings taking place, I gotta admit, I was enchanted. Not so enchanting was after I walked around the building I realize we still had not been seated. There were probably about 4 tables of customers, but I was shocked to look at my watch and see it was 1:50pm. I mean, 10 minutes at a near empty restaurant? Come on.\\n\\nWe were led through the honeycomb of rooms to an area that had a view of the historic Hayden flour mill under construction. I guess it wasn't the prettiest picture with the state of the building and halting of the restoration, but it promoted some conversation I suppose. Country music crooned gently in the background, the restaurant felt quite but that was likely due to the size and lack of customers. I can never resist baked potato soup, and upon ordering it and some sprites it was a mere 2 minute wait. I remember thinking to myself, now we're talking! Creamy, peppery, thick with potato, I thought it was a very nice version, but I still rate Crackers and Co version my favorite. It was almost too heavy, but still, I was happy. The server also asked if I wanted to have the Monti Bread, which turned out to be decent but room temperature. It was pretty tasty regardless with dill, garlic, almost-but-not-quite over salted, an almost fluffy interior. I just really regret the temp it came out at, I thought it could've been great it it came out hot.\\n\\nUnfortunately ,the temperature as well as the I-don't-mind-taking-my-time-and-thus-your-time theme continued. When my lunch order of 7oz prime rib came out, along with mashed potatoes I ordered as a side that came with it, we were in the 20-25 minute range. 3 containers of au jus, horseradish blended, and sour cream were the perfect accompaniments for my lunch. The mashed potatoes were great, melting-in-the-mouth variety while being slightly firm, hate liquidy mashed that you find at lazy restaurants. The prime rib I ordered medium rare, and it was, also seasoned very well, was luscious, although I must admit its the first time I've had prime rib for probably 2 years. My girlfriend ordered the fettuccine chicken alfredo, which had a nicely rich without being oily sauce, and the pasta was tender. However the chicken almost seemed to be an afterthought, without feeling much seasoning and just mopping up the sauce, and being slightly dry. With that said, a feeling of wistfulness pervaded my meal, because I felt that it could've been amazing, but was done in by service issues. I enjoyed it, I will probably go back, but in the recesses of my mind I'll be judging and wondering if being teased by a the promise of a great experience and being let down to a good one will be worth it. This place will either be a place I come to love or hate, hopefully the former!\\n\\n7oz prime rib w/side lunch: 11.99\\nfettuccine chicken alfredo: 14.99\\n2 soft drinks: I think about $6\\nthe soups didn't appear on the bill, but they would've been 2.99 for a cup, 3.99 for a bowl.\\n\\nI'm a fan for now, but subsequent visits will determine a final rating.",

It's a bobby flay restaurant so you get the southwest influence which is typically a crowd pleaser also.  I recommend the shrimp tamale appetizer, pork tenderloin, and the veal chop.  It also isn't terribly pricey for a nice strip restaurant and has a cool atmosphere.\\n\\nI haven't had the brunch but it's only on the weekends and it looks real good.",

After reading yelp reviews as well as trip advisor, we went ahead and booked... plus the price was definitely right!  We weren't disappointed. We checked in pretty late close to midnight & had a special request (we were to stay in a studio for 3 days then transfer to a 2 bedroom unit when our family members arrived later that week). Christina at the check-in desk was absolutely wonderful & most accommodating. She ensured that we got a studio that was attached to a 1 bedroom unit scheduled to be vacant so that we wouldn't have to make a big move or go through the hassle of checking out then checking in again. That was really awesome. Sales pitch was never an issue with us as it was not mentioned even once!  The studio unit is honestly pretty small & can feel almost claustrophobic at times, but it is clean, well kept & good value. When the door tp the adjacent 1 bedroom unit opened up (to make a 2 bedroom unit), we had plenty of place to move about. Large seating area, a full kitchen & a big bedroom were fantastic. Overall, we enjoyed our stay at the Polo towers.  The walk to the Las Vegas blvd is less than half a block - it was much shorter walk than I thought it would be!  Mid-strip location was also fantastic. Convenience stores (including the one within the polo tower), a discount show ticket booth, cheap fast food restaurants are very close.

        "ori": "(3.5 stars)\\n\\nThis Comme Ca is David Myers' newest restaurant (located on the 3rd floor of The Cosmopolitan).  The original Comme Ca in LA can be good or quite average (depending on what you order).  The Vegas location features a pretty similar menu (the same good/average may apply).\\n\\nThis Comme Ca has a much better decor/atmosphere.  I've always felt the Comme Ca in LA has really just inhabited its location rather than transformed it.  The layout and design is so much more well thought out here as it combines both French brasserie characteristics and modern touches (which is kind of like the menu--classic French bistro re-imagined for a contemporary audience). \\n\\nThe room at lunchtime also takes advantage of its Vegas location.  They use floor-to-ceiling windows that bring in a lot of warm natural light (as well as provide a good view of nearby casinos).  I think there is also an outdoor dining area, which probably incorporates The Strip even more.\\n\\nFor food, the meal began with a complimentary French baguette--similar to the one they serve in LA but not as good.  It was freshly baked and warm; however, the crust was a little too hard and the bread was too chewy.\\n\\nI went with the 3-course lunch pre fixe ($32).  They give you a good variety of choices in entrees as well as a decent variety in starters and desserts.\\n\\nI started with the endive and watercress salad that was garnished with blue cheese, julienne apple, roasted walnuts, and a sprightly vinaigrette.  The endives were fresh and crisp (great snap to them).  The watercress was also fresh and good.  The combination made for a good salad base.\\n\\nThe garnishes were good.  The walnuts provided a good crunch while the green apple gave the salad a good tart flavor.  I also liked the blue cheese, which had a good creaminess to it and was not too pungent, but there was not much of it.  The salad was nicely dressed with the vinaigrette.  It was a light tossing, which kept all the ingredients crisp and not soggy.  Still, the vinaigrette was a little acidic.\\n\\nFor my entree, I went with the Scottish Salmon that came with artisanal polenta and oyster mushrooms.  It was a decent portion for a lunch entree.  The salmon was moist and had a good outside sear.  The outside sear had a good flavor, which made it feel like they left the skin-on (even though they didn't).  Salmon can have a strong fish flavor and this one certainly did.\\n\\nThe polenta was creamy and pretty good though polenta is not my favorite side.  There was also a mild cream sauce that did not really do much.  There were also some oyster mushrooms on the plate, which were nicely cooked and not rubbery.  Unfortunately, they were incredibly salty.\\n\\nFor dessert, I went with the profiteroles.  Like the LA Comme Ca, the profiteroles at lunch were not the standard profiteroles filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with a dark chocolate sauce.  Instead, they filled the profiteroles with Chantilly cream and then topped them with vanilla ice cream and a crystallized sugar garnish.  They then poured a dark chocolate sauce over top of it.\\n\\nThe presentation was nicer than the LA Comme Ca's lunch dessert.  Also, the dark chocolate sauce was thinner and had a much better and smoother flavor (but still rich).  The vanilla ice cream was good and creamy.  I liked the crystallized sugar garnish, which provided a good sweetness and crispy contrast.\\n\\nThe profiteroles though were not the type of profiteroles I am used to; the profiteroles here were quite small.  They were very crisp on the outside and were not light, airy and soft on the inside.  They tasted more like a cross between a profiterole and a brioche cookie/biscuit.  I saw a photo on Yelp where the profiteroles looked to have the appropriate size and texture so it might just have been the day I went.  The Chantilly cream filling was good.\\n\\nThe waitress (Andrea) seemed new (it is a new restaurant after all) and very trained.  She did a good job.  She was pleasant, personable, polite, and very attentive throughout the course of the meal.  She also (though this didn't really impact the overall dining experience) looked very similar to an actress, but I couldn't pinpoint who.\\n\\nComme Ca's $32 3-course lunch prix fixe is a good deal especially when you consider all the overpriced restaurants in Vegas.  In terms of their regular prices, the prices here are about what you would expect to pay at Bouchon (The Venetian); since they are both French bistros, they have many similar items.  The food at Comme Ca might be slightly less.\\n\\nIf you haven't been to the Comme Ca in LA, this one is a decent lunch option for Vegas.  The food was not spectacular, but there was consistent quality with each dish (the mushrooms being the exception).  If you've been to the Comma Ca in LA, You may want to branch out and try something new since the menu is similar.\\n\\nComplimentary parking via valet; parking structure may also be available.",

The soups are still bland and usually under-seasoned.  The daily specials are usually pretty good (sometimes under-seasoned) and a decent value.  There still isn't anywhere else in Oakland that you can get what Red Oak offers - and that's the sole reason that I've returned, albeit with far less frequency that I'd like to return.\\n\\nThe reason that I don't go there more often - the reason that I've always hated going to Red Oak Cafe - is the poor management that is reflected in consistently poor service.  Every single time I go there, the service falls short, I usually end up waiting far longer than I should (in the middle of the workday when I have other things to do), and it's irritating to me.  Really irritating.\\n\\nFor example, I went there last week to order a salad for takeout.  After ordering, I stood with three other customers and waited.  An employee (who looked to be a local college student) was carrying on a personal conversation with the cook - less than three feet in front of waiting customers.  After concluding his conversation, he started a new conversation with the cashier - asking whether a prior customer left a tip.  After learning that the customer didn't leave a tip, the worker carried on a multi-minute diatribe insulting the prior customer, and preening himself in front of the growing crowd (who were also waiting for food).  After this, he then had the audacity to ask us what we had ordered (all salads), and then proceeded to quickly throw together out salads - after we had all waited for him to finish his display of unprofessional behavior.  He should have been fired on the spot.\\n\\nThe man who appears to be the owner is frequently scrambling around filling orders and trying to do too much himself - while his lazy and undisciplined college student staff lounges around looking hapless and disinterested.  Every single visit involves one or more displays of thoughtless and unprofessional behavior: the cutlery tray is empty - because someone didn't do his/her job to see that it was filled with clean cutlery; food is left on the takeout countertop while its customer waits because of poor communication with customers; customers wait while workers stand around looking clueless; workers have inappropriate personal conversations in front of customers; food ordered to-go is plated for in-house consumption, etc.  It's a horribly run business.\\n\\nThat's why I'm done with the Red Oak Cafe.  It's too bad.  I makes me wish that someone with better management skills would open another cafe to directly compete with Red Oak in their food offerings .

We had a party of 9, and they only gave us one small dish. We asked for another and the server said we need to charge for an extra dish (keep in mind parties of 2 next to us were able to get the same sized dish we had). Then she goes to the back and brings an extra dish out saying, \\\"\"nevermind, here's another one 'FREE OF CHARGE'\\\"\"... It seemed from there she was already annoyed at us?\\n\\nAnyway, I had the wonton noodle soup. Simple enough, right? Wrong! The broth and noodles were nothing special, just what you'd expect.

They tasted like they have been sitting there for at least a week in the fridge and the meat has started to go bad. I couldn't even finish my first one.\\n\\nThen we had a rice dish served in a clay pot. This is where the server brings it out, mixes it for you, and then serves it to you in bowls. Upon first bite, my aunt found a strand of white hair and we immediately notified the waitress. From then on, the service dropped significantly. She did the routine \\\"\"did you want to change the dish to something else?\\\"\" in which we decided to change to a fried rice dish (which was fine, no complaints there).

We can DEFINITELY tell what is hair and what is 'glass noodle'. She never apologized for her attitude, nor the fact that there was hair in our food.\\n\\nWhen we received our bill, they charged us for the fried rice, AND the rice dish in the clay pot, in which we refuted because we only took one bite out of it and returned it.

They were soon joined by another gal and I was left sitting in the waiting area until 12:13 having to listen to all 4 of them talk and order lunch.

For dessert we had the milk chocolate fondue.  It was a nice change of pace dessert.  It included things like gummy bears and marshmallows that you dip in chocolate.

We arrived at our scheduled reservation and were promptly seated...on the other side of the room away from any other guest, as if we were lepers.  It literally took 20 minutes for a waiter to show up to take our drink order.  We told her that we're ready to order appetizers and meal at this point.  After waiting another 20 minutes our meal shows up minus the appetizers, btw again no one has stopped to see how we're doing during this time.  The next time we see the waiter we mention that the appetizer never showed up and to be sure to remove it off the bill.  He came, apologized and said that he was able to remove it off the bill (as though this was a favor to us).  Later on the manage came by and asked how the food was.  When I replied fine, a bit angrily, he asked what was wrong.  I mentioned about the appetizer he acted like \\\"\"hey, it's ok, we've taken it off the bill\\\"\" unapologetically.\\nI also noticed the staff were VERY young, no older than their mid 20's so it's clear they are not experienced with providing a high level of service.

Another VERY UNUSUAL offering was smoked salmon with caviar garnishes (chopped eggs, red onion, capers). Is this a dish that is unique to Charlotte or the south?

For dessert, there were giant chocolate-dipped strawberries. \\n\\nAlso unique to this place is the all you can eat made-to-order tapas menu that comes with brunch. The walnut-crusted French toast with mixed berries was sublime. The classic eggs benedict was good, not great.\\n\\nWhat was bad: they had an appetizer selection of cheese and fruit that was unimaginative, unappealing and un-quality (yes I made that word up to get the point across). Generic cubed hard cheeses and melon and strawberries that were under-ripe and looked like they hadn't been vetted for quality. The shrimp and grits was absolutely awful: a soup of gravy, some overcooked tomatoes and you had to fish around for the damn shrimp. The prime rib was overcooked and dry.

I would have rather given Stingray a 1.5.  Their food is very mediocre and WAY overpriced.  I felt robbed when I left.  I don't normally post reviews about restaurants but I wanted to warn other since felt so cheated out of a good sushi experience.   If you want to hear more ranting read blow:\\n\\nThe service was sub-par, both in serving and in feeling welcome.  The decor is awesome and it looks fancy, a great look for a date, yet only take a date who is afraid to even trying sushi, there isn't much taste in the rolls, so a sushi novice would handle the situation alright.  However the menus are poorly made, so if I hadn't already known some of the rolls I would have never known what they were made of. Only the special rolls have a description. Plus, the heaters outside are too close to the tops of your head, I felt like my forehead was being cooked.\\n\\nTo be fair, I have been to lots of sushi restaurants, expensive and inexpensive, even a bunch in Japan, so I am familiar with good sushi...... and I may be more critical than some.

I love restaurants who give you happy hour prices on your drink even if you ordered them at 5:58pm when HH ends at 6pm. Believe it or not, some places out there would ignore your table for two minutes just to avoid the HH. So lame. This scored huge points in my book. For food, we ordered the edamame for our appetizer and the Veggie Pesto Pizza for dinner. \\n\\nThe Edamame was super fresh. If you've ever had bad or even mediocre edamame, you get it. Its disgusting. I wasn't expecting anything phenomenal but was genuinely happy when I actually wanted to keep eating more of it. The pizza had buttloads of flavor! Artichoke hearts, olives, mushrooms, tomato's, mozarella and feta cheese and pesto. Mmmm.

I got a Restaurant.com coupon, and was totally craving some good Italian food, but I'm also a big fan of Japanese food so this combination of Italian-Japanese sounded great.  The location was okay, though a bit hard to find.  The place was well-decorated, as you'd expect for a Japanese place, and the waitress was nice, though not particularly energetic nor friendly.  \\n\\nThe menu was interesting.  Since I wanted to try their uniqueness, and not where they're the same as any other Japanese place, I wanted to focus on the pasta.  We ordered a chicken pasta with Japanese mushrooms, along with a salisbury steak made of beef and kurobuta pork.  For an appetizer, we had the calamari tempura, and dessert was a gelato with Kinako and black honey.  Here's each in turn:\\n\\nCalamari Tempura:  Nothing special, despite being on the specials menu.  It was exactly what it says:  Deep-friend pieces of squid (Japanese cut) with breading.  \\n\\nChicken with Japanese mushrooms:  Weird.  Basically it was a spaghetti in a broth, with a few pieces of chicken and some mushrooms in it.  I can't really describe the taste, aside from it being fairly bland and a bit salty.  It didn't seem like the mushrooms added much to the flavor, and all together seemed like a thrown together mish-mash.  \\n\\nBeef and Kurobuta Pork Salisburg Steak:  Entirely mediocre.  It's just a Salisbury steak.  This one came with a salad, two slices of orange, a sprig of broccoli, and small pasta birdsnest.  The cold pasta thing was really good, actually.  Saved the dish from being entirely forgettable.\\n\\nGelato with Kinako and Black Honey:  This was pretty good.  Seemed like a sweet cream gelato with a bittersweet honey and kinako crumbs, which added nothing almost to the flavor, but was a good choice for some texture to what would otherwise have been plain ice cream.  \\n\\nOverall, the service was a bit a slow, and not very friendly, but not rude.

My friend and I decided to share 3 different desserts: strawberry cheesecake, pumpkin vanilla bundt cake, and banana cream pie.\\n\\nStrawberry cheese cake: the cheesecake part was delicious. The cake that was under it felt stale. It was hard. It felt so stale and dry that we thought they did that on purpose, but why would someone purposely make cake dry? \\n\\nBanana cream pie: it was hard to break into the crust. It felt like bananas topped with whipped cream in a crust bowl. It just was not what I was looking for.\\n\\nPumpkin vanilla bundt cake: the only dessert that was a little more satisfying. It definitely stood out from the other two. I enjoyed the pumpkin. The cake felt a lot less dry than the strawberry cheesecake.\\n\\nI'm not sure if I would want to give this place another try due to only enjoying 1/3 desserts.

A word to the wise: Will Call is located at the concierge desk, which is next to the front desk, a brisk walk away from the showroom. This may have been the case for this show only, but our tickets were not actually at Will Call; they were being held, along with everyone else's at the door to the showroom. It took a lot of walking and being misdirected, but we eventually got into the venue.\\n\\nAnother word to the wise: this place is teeny tiny. Maybe 250-300 people max. The seating is arranged almost exactly like the South Point showroom: the front area has long tables radiating out from the stage, while the back section has round booths. It seems like this is the go-to arrangement for a venue with a semi-circle stage, but all it gives the audience is a bad viewing angle and a sore neck. \\n\\nThere is nothing special about the venue itself. Typical Vegas, with a gold ceiling, giant chandeliers and red velvet booths. \\n\\nOn this occasion, it seems like the show was vastly oversold, leading the ushers to pull chairs from wherever they could and seat people in the aisles. Kind of a bummer. \\n\\nA tip: there is drink service within the venue, but it's by waitress, so it can be slow and the waitress (just the one, mind you) covered maybe half the venue. While it is \\\"\"technically\\\"\" against the rules, there doesn't seem to be any restriction on bringing drinks from the casino bar into the showroom. \\n\\nWhile I don't know how much of our experience was due to an outside company running the show itself, the experience was meh.",

I believe with the tasting you only get like four samples for $20.00 so might as well try more and spend less. I love how you can choose different sizes of wine..the taster, 1/2 glass, full glass, and bottle. Way fun! \\n\\nThe dessert wines were my favorite!

Today's prompt me to write review.

It seems that Paradise Bakery, and my not so positive experience, will be the first of what I hope are many reviews.  \\n\\nWhy would Paradise Bakery not charge $.25 for an individual chipper escapes me.  I don't want to buy (eat) 6 chippers. I just want to (should) buy 1.  Normally, I am offered a complimentary chipper when I offer to buy one.  \\\"\"Oh no... have it on us\\\"\" is the typical response.  \\n\\nToday, however, the courteous girl behind the counter explained she could not sell one to me and she could not give one to me either.  \\n\\nFrankly, this makes no sense.  I would more than willingly spend $.25 on a chipper yet Paradise will not take my money or sell me their product.",

Plus, after paying that steep $ just for parking, they never charged our Tesla after we made the long trek from Orange County. We rolled into town with 50 miles left on our battery and told valet to please charge the car. They promised to do so, but almost 3 hours later, I check on my car with my app and find out they never touched it, let alone charge it. Then, I wasn't comfortable driving out around town to dinner and whatever because of the low battery. \\n\\nOther than valet problems, decor is new, rooms redone cosmetically, and that's about it. I don't know if I would bother staying here again in the future when there are so many other better options in Vegas.",

I was a little disappointed in the baba ganoush dish as I expected it to be more like the aydari. My husband totally loved the shawarma, chicken combo and the garlic spread.

Oh well.. Anyway, after reading the review's for Sami's Gyros I was hoping it would have improved upon their food. Unfortunately, she (or he - Sami is a little ambiguous) just hasn't cleaned herself up, yet. \\n\\nI went here recently for the first time for lunch after getting a Groupon deal (It was close to me, okay?!) and pretty much most of the negative reviews were right. Let's break it down:\\n\\n-The side salad included \\\"\"generous\\\"\" portions of one olive, one thin slice of cucumber, and one slice of tomato.\\n\\n- I had the Mediterranean chicken \\\"\"sandwich\\\"\". From reading the previous reviews, I knew that I should order a side of tzatziki sauce. Unfortunately, even after soaking the \\\"\"sandwich\\\"\", the chicken was still dry as hell. So, I was left with a huge sloppy mess, which I'm okay with. Those are usually fun.\\n\\n-The fries were pretty damn tasteless. Why else would you even get fries if they aren't tasty? It's not like they are healthy or anything. They ended up as useless as a fishnet condom. The ketchup packets that were included had high fructose corn syrup in them, and I don't do that. So, I used the fries as a conduit to get more tzatziki sauce into my mouth. That still didn't help the tasteless fries.  \\n\\nThe best part was the \\\"\"China Mist\\\"\" tea. Yes, the throw in drink was the best part. I feel sorta bad for writing a bad review after using a Groupon... But fuck it. Hey Sami, what's up brah? If you need help improving your food, including your dry meat, let me know!",

Both are subpar at this particular spot. Long lines out into the terminal because the store is understaffed, and that leads to abrupt, harried staff who in turn provide an unpleasant experience for the guests. \\n\\nThere are also unpacked boxes of inventory lining the walls.

Whatever it is, it would take you at least 5 minutes to order over the phone.\\n\\nThe non-Asian folks normally eat sweet and sour chicken, Szechuan beef, crab rangoons, egg foo yong, veggie fried rice and, eggplant and tofu.

The other two times, the servers were slow--not checking back to see how our food was, not refilling drinks, etc.  Last time, our server was outright rude.  She made several mistakes (forgot our appetizer, cornbread, did not refill water) and only offered a half-hearted apology.  She rolled her eyes at my husband.  Just totally uncalled for.  Honestly, I love their food, but I probably won't go back here when there are so many other options in Charlotte.  They really need to invest in some server training.  Also, it would help to have a manager out walking the floor.  I have never seen a manager here, and would definitely have welcomed the chance to give feedback in person rather than on Yelp.

        "ori": "I came here during lunchtime today for their \\\"\"renowned Salt & Pepper Pork Chops.\\\"\"\\n\\nI was extremely disappointed, let me explain.\\n\\nThe portion was very small (at least the one I got) comparing to other places such as Keung Kee or Restaurant Cantonais, and there is no consistency in their dishes. I've got about half a bowl of rice while others got much bigger portions.\\n\\nThe pork chops were extremely overcooked and very tough to eat, my fork was entirely bent when I was trying to cut through those things. The seasoning was alright, and the outer shells were very crispy, but that cannot mask the toughness of the meat. \\n\\nFurthermore, there is no \\\"\"Chinese green veggies\\\"\" or fried eggs as advertised and mentioned by other Yelpers. You can find some bits of eggs here and there in the rice, and that's it, talking about cutting costs.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had the Sichuan Style Tofu, and it was basically fried tofu stir-fried with onions and sweet chili sauce. It was extremely bland and disgusting to eat, not to mention that fried tofu does not even exist in Sichuanese cuisine.\\n\\nThe wonton soup that came with the lunch specials was pretty good, right amount of fillings and the seasoning was alright. Their Spicy & Sour soup was very watery and lacked all sorts of seasoning.\\n\\nThe restaurant is ran by one chef and one waiter, and therefore there is almost no service as the waiter was busy serving 7 tables. We had to write our orders ourselves...\\n\\nThe ambiance is pretty dark and boring, the restaurant is very small but not comfy or cozy at all. It is not well lit and the place is not very clean either.\\n\\nThe difference from the actual dining experience and these Yelp reviews from 2010 would be comparing your Big Mac with the one in an McDonald's ad. I'm not sure if we went on an off-day but I seriously doubt it, if they can screw up their \\\"\"signature dish\\\"\" this badly then it's pretty pointless to come back and try again.",

        "ori": "I had to sit for a few minutes to think about how I was going to rate Seksun.  If I was rating this restaurant 7 months ago, I would give it 5 starts without hesitation.  Lately it has been 1 star and if I could rate lower I would.  2 stars at this point is being kind.\\n\\nMy family started going to Seksun after another family member gave out gift certificates for Christmas.  She described it as \\\"\"the best sushi you have ever eaten!\\\"\"  Given the fact that my fianc\\u00e9e refuses to eat most fish, getting him to go was a struggle.  Once we did, Seksun became a favorite.  We would go to eat dinner here AT LEAST once a week.  Sometimes 2-3x's/week depending on if we were going out with friends. \\n\\nWe loved it here.  The sushi on the belt was always cold and fresh and my picky fianc\\u00e9e found he liked the Ca. roll, and his favorite the Flash Star.  Since he cant handle seaweed he would order the rolls made with soy paper.  Go between 4-7pm and it is happy hour.  .50 off all rolls from the belt, .99 appetizers, and cheap beers.  We LOVED happy hour!  The crab puffs are the best we ever had, and I LOVE the Red Dragon.\\n\\nFrom the first time we went, there was always a little communication barrier with the staff since he was special ordering with the soy paper, and we would usually have to correct mistakes on our bill, but we could handle the language barrier and they rarely argued with their mistakes.  It was a fun atmosphere and we started to get to know the staff.  After a few months, we almost always got the manager, Jackie, to be our waiter.  He knew us so well, he remembered our order.  In fact, we were able to special order items that weren't even on the menu with him.  \\n\\nThen Jackie was gone. :(  I think it is his wife that took over the place, and ever since, it has been HORRIBLE service and the food is getting straight up gross.\\n\\nI have seen better service during non happy hour times, but going during happy hour seems to burden the staff and they get annoyed if you order any rolls that aren't on the belt.  Now, if we order rolls from the menu we actually get sighs, or the waitresses (who seem to know less and less English) point to the conveyer belt when we ask for rolls with soy paper, or hot edemame instead of the room temperature stuff on the belt.  When we special order during happy hour it usually takes at least 40 minutes to get our rolls.  and EVERYTIME they get our order wrong.  My 3 piece rolls usually come out first, and the leftover 6 pieces get put on the conveyer belt, my fianc\\u00e9e's orders usually come out 20-30 minutes later.  IT WOULD BE NICE TO GET OUR FOOD AT THE SAME TIME SO WE CAN EAT TOGETHER.  \\n\\nThe last time we went, we decided it was going to be our last time.  Our order was completely wrong.  The appetizers sat in the back so long that they were room temperature by the time the waitress brought it to us.  I pulled my order from the belt and nothing was cold or fresh.  The soy paper order came out in 30 minutes, but it was with seaweed and we sent it back (after having to tear the roll apart to show the waitress, who was arguing with us, that it wasn't made with soy paper.)  30 minutes longer, we finally got his order, and one of the rolls was wrong again.  We NEVER got the hot edamame that we had ordered an hour before.  The worst for me was, after being there for well over an hour, I had watched the SAME roll go around on the conveyer belt.  The same sushi sitting out for over an hour.  I am certain they never changed it out.\\n\\nThe next day I got sick.  Head in the toilet for 2 days straight kind of sick.  Maybe it was the flu, but no one else in my household caught it.  I am still considering calling the health department.  \\n\\nOh well, I guess it is time for a change for my family.  Sorry Seksun, hopefully you'll bring Jackie back before your doors are forced to close.",
